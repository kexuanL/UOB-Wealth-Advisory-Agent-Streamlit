Goldman Sachs Research analysts now assess the current\nemployment status of women in India and explore opportunities that lie ahead.\nWhile India benefits from favorable demographics, it will not reap the full\nbenefits unless women become a larger part of its labor force. The female labor\nforce participation rate in India is significantly below the male participation\nrate and also below these rates in other major economies. One of the key reasons\nfor women's low participation in the labor force is that the women in India bear\na disproportionate responsibility for domestic and care-giving activities.\nIndian women spend ~8x more time on a daily basis in domestic and care-giving\nservices than men. However, an encouraging development over the past few years\nhas been the rise of self-employed women in India. Women in corporate India are\nunder-represented but gradually gaining ground. Going forward, our analysts find\nthat building a robust ‘care economy’ (a network of child care centers and elder\ncare ecosystem) would (a) free up women’s time for paid employment opportunities\nelsewhere, and (b) create greater employment opportunities for the 'care work'\nservices sector."}
{"article_title": "The Future of European Defense", "publish_date": "2025-06-30", "url": "https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/the-future-of-european-defense", "source": "GoldmanSachs", "content": "This opinion article was originally published in Les Echos\n[https://www.lesechos.fr/idees-debats/cercle/a-leurope-de-jouer-par-david-solomon-pdg-de-goldman-sachs-2172561]\non June 24, 2025.\n\n \n\nOne of the most striking things about my conversations with CEOs at the\nbeginning of the year was the deep pessimism about Europe. While it is important\nnot to understate the challenges still facing the Continent, especially as\nconflict continues both on the Continent and in the Middle East, that negativity\nhas undergone a remarkable reversal.\n\nAs I convene our Board of Directors in Paris this week, it’s clear to us that\nthis nascent optimism presents an opportunity. European nations are making\nmeaningful strides towards a more cohesive defence policy, and the Continent\nwould also benefit from making more cohesive economic and financial\nstrides—especially by reducing cross-border frictions and harnessing the power\nof a more integrated capital market and banking union.\n\nI see reasons to be encouraged that Europe can make progress. \n\nEU leaders clearly recognise that greater autonomy in the realm of defence and\nsecurity is both a strategic and economic imperative.\n\nFirst, the agreement of a new spending target among NATO members, and the\nhistoric shift in Germany’s positioning earlier this year, is testament to a\nfundamental change in mindset. As defence expenditures accelerate, the Eurozone\nis forecast to grow at a faster rate than predicted just a few months ago, with\nthis fiscal expansion as a tailwind.\n\nTo be clear, prolonged war benefits no one. We are hopeful for swift and\npeaceful resolutions to the current conflicts.   \n\nSecond, Europe retains important strengths. While international investors would\nlike to see faster action, reforms in recent years by individual countries have\nimproved tax regimes to attract talent and Europe remains one of the richest and\nlargest economies in the world.\n\nOur experience is a case in point. Over the last few years, Goldman Sachs has\nsignificantly scaled up our operations across Europe—from Warsaw to Frankfurt,\nand Milan to The Hague. Here in Paris, we opened a new office to accommodate our\ngrowing footprint, with almost 500 positions now on the ground and all our\nbusiness lines represented in the city. This would not have been possible\nwithout the positive reform agenda in France.\n\nFinally, Europe benefits from a rich talent pool. Its schools and universities,\nespecially for business and engineering, are globally competitive. It does not\nlack for hungry and driven young professionals who are the foundation of firms\nlike ours.\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde and European Commission President Ursula von der\nLeyen have recently made the same point: Per million inhabitants, the EU\nproduces almost as many science, technology, engineering, and mathematics\ngraduates as the US.\n\nThe open question is why these strengths have not translated to the same level\nof economic and entrepreneurial dynamism as in the United States.\n\nI believe Europe can achieve economic dynamism, but only if more decisive\nactions are taken to unlock the full potential of the European market. These\nactions will require popular and political will, but there is reason to expect\nEurope can surmount the obstacles.\n\nI offer five key suggestions as Europe seeks to reform its economy for a new\nera.\n\nFirst, Europe should be clear-eyed about the burdens its regulatory environment\ncurrently places on business. I see it at Goldman Sachs and hear it from the\nCEOs I speak to around the world: Europe remains an outlier in terms of the\nextensive—often overbearing, duplicative, and costly—obligations it places on\nfirms. Mario Draghi put this in stark terms: Europe’s internal barriers and\nregulatory hurdles are equivalent to a tariff of 110% for services and 45% for\nmanufacturing.\n\nI would encourage EU policymakers to look at the regulatory infrastructure that\nhas mushroomed over the years in Brussels. Reducing or eliminating unwieldy and\nineffective structures and processes will send a loud message that the EU is\nfocused on efficiency, results, and economic growth. \n\nAs such, we warmly welcome the focus from the new European Commission, as well\nas leaders like President Macron and Chancellor Merz, on an ambitious programme\nof regulatory and administrative simplification. From our perspective, the scale\nof the challenge calls for a bold rethink, not tinkering around the edges.\n\nThe aim of reducing reporting burdens on business by 25% is a helpful north\nstar. But meeting it will require both a different and detailed approach. The\nindustry is eager to have a dialogue about how to focus reporting on information\nthat is genuinely useful to authorities. \n\nSecond, member states need to play their part in building the pools of long-term\ncapital needed to channel financing more forcefully into both public and private\nmarkets—where much of the economic activity in Europe is now happening. Plugging\ngaps in auto-enrolment, consolidating pension schemes, and introducing\ncompelling incentives for retail participation in capital markets are key steps\nto take without undue delay.\n\nA fundamental prerequisite of a Europe-wide ‘Savings & Investments Union’ is a\nstrong capital market underpinned by robust engagement from institutional and\nretail investors. Europe is building on solid foundations in this respect, with\nan internationally regarded equity market structure that has seen it weather\nrecent episodes of volatility effectively.\n\nThird, special attention must be paid to Europe’s venture and growth capital\necosystem. This means freeing up pension funds and insurers to engage more with\nearly-stage investments while looking at the scope for public funding to\n“de-risk” potential projects. America’s enormous advantage in the availability\nof early-stage risk capital is among its most important distinguishing features.\n\nEurope must offer greater support for small businesses to engage investors and\nsimplify the cross-border regulatory regime they face. \n\nFourth, it’s time for the EU to demonstrate a more serious commitment to its now\ndecade-old pledge of creating a unified capital market. Any moves toward\nintegration will allow more companies to diversity their funding, facilitate\ncross-border investment, and catalyse the risk-taking necessary for the\ninnovation needed to better compete in the global economy.\n\nThe final piece is naturally the most challenging: How does Europe work\ncollectively to put its interests first when one or two countries veto reform in\norder to protect their narrow parochial interests? I know this question goes\nback to the beginning of the EU. But decades of experience and evidence make it\nclear today: The focus on national interests over EU-wide interests is\nthrottling the economic, financial, diplomatic, and military power of the\nregion—the opposite of the goals of the EU founders.\n\nNow is the time to translate ideas into tangible change. As I said earlier, the\nopportunity is there for the taking. Greater independence in an uncertain\ngeopolitical landscape, nurturing world-leading innovative firms, and offering\ncitizens the opportunity to benefit themselves through a true investment union,\nare major prizes.\n\nMy hope is for Europe to succeed in this endeavour. In a fragmented and\nincreasingly volatile world, a self-reliant and dynamic Europe benefits us all. "}

So, what will global aging mean\nfor our economic future? I'm Allison Nathan and this is\nGoldman Sachs Exchanges.\nToday I'm sitting down with my colleague, Kevin Daly, co-\nhead of the Economics team covering Central and Eastern\nEurope, the Middle East, and Africa within Global Macro\nResearch. Kevin, welcome back to Exchanges.\nKevin Daly: Thank you very much, Allison. Good to see\n\n2\nyou.\nAllison Nathan: So, Kevin, you've done a lot of work\naround your path to 2075 Series looking at what the global\neconomy could look like 50 years from now. And you\nrecently released a report about global aging. It's no secret\nthat the global population is aging. But first, give us the\nfacts behind that. What measure do you look at to\ndetermine this? And what does it show?\nKevin Daly: Allison, however you measure it, the global\npopulation is aging. So, if you look at the median ages in\ndeveloped economies, 50 years ago the median age was 30.\nNow it's 43. Over the next 50 years, that's expected to rise\nto 47. For emerging economies, they're significantly\nyounger. But the median age there has also risen from 19\nto 30 currently. And it's projected to rise to 40 over the\nnext 50 years.\nThe other way that economists like to look at it is to look at\ndevelopments in the working age ratio. So, what is the\nshare of the population that is between the ages of 15 to\n64? For developed economies, that peaked just before the\nturn of the century, around 67 percent. It's currently at 63\n\n3\npercent and is projected, over the next 50 years, to fall to\n57 percent. So, however you cut it, the global population is\naging.\nAllison Nathan: So, what's driving that process of\npopulation aging?\nKevin Daly: I mean, there are two developments. There's\nincreased longevity and declining fertility. On increased\nlongevity, life expectancy has risen in the what\ndemographers call the longevity frontier. So, this is the\ncountry with the highest longevity in the world. 100 years\nago, that was Australia. And the life expectancy was 63. 50\nyears ago, that country was Iceland with a life expectancy\nof 75. Currently, the country with the highest life\nexpectancy in the world is Hong Kong with 86 years.\nIf you look at that trend, over time that's rising very\nsteadily. And for 150 years has been rising steadily at a\nrate of about a quarter of a year every year. If you look at\nthe global economy as a whole, actually it's been rising\neven faster than that because there's been some\nconvergence to the frontier. So, countries with the lowest\nlife expectancies have seen the biggest increases. So, on\n\n4\naverage, it's risen by about a third of a year every year. So,\nthat longevity is contributing to population aging.\nThe other factor, as I said, is fertility. So, fertility has fallen\npretty significantly globally. It peaked at 5.4 in 1963. So,\nthat's total fertility per woman. And is now fallen to 2.1. In\ndeveloped economies, it's actually significantly lower than\nthat at 1.5. In emerging economies it's at 2.2.\nAllison Nathan: So, let's take those in turn. First of all,\nlongevity. Isn't it a good thing that we are living longer?\nWe're all striving to live longer. In some ways that is the\nproduct of innovation and technological advancement and\neverything else, is to be able to live longer.\nKevin Daly: It's a very basic point. But it's a very good\none. And it's one that I think a lot of economists often miss.\nIs that the fact that we're living longer, and not only longer,\nbut also healthier lives, is a fantastic testament to the\nscientific progress that we have made over the last couple\nof centuries. And as I say, it's not just that we're living\nlonger, we're also living healthier lives as well. There was a\nvery comprehensive study done by the IMF recently\npublished which looked at 50-year-olds over the last\n\n5\nquarter of a century. And it found that on average,\nsomebody who's 70 today has the same cognitive abilities\nas somebody who was 53 in the year 2000. 25 years ago.\nWhen you look at physical ability, somebody who is 70\ntoday has the same physical abilities as somebody who was\n56 in the year 2000. In a very real and tangible sense, 70 is\nthe new 53. So, this is a fantastic benefit for us.\nAllison Nathan: That's really striking, actually. Even in\nthe year 2000, which is very fresh in our memories, that we\nhave had such a big improvement. Very interesting.\nKevin Daly: I know. People are sometimes surprised at\nthat. But if you look at the TV shows from the 1980s, from\nthe 1990s, you look at some of these actors or even sports\nstars from that period and you take pictures of these\npeople and you go, you know, that actor was in his 30s\nwhen he was doing that role. And often these people are\npeople who today would pass for somebody in their 40s or\ntheir 50s. So, it is however you measure it, both physically,\nboth mentally, how people look, we are living significantly\nlonger and healthier lives.\n\n6\nAllison Nathan: And so, we are seeing a big rise in life\nexpectancy.\nKevin Daly: We are. And actually, the official data, I\nthink, are understanding the true increase in life\nexpectancy because life expectancy data that are commonly\nquoted are actually not really a measure of life expectancy\nin the true sense, they're a measure of what are the age of\npeople dying at today. So, when we say in an average\ndeveloped economy life expectancy is 82 years old, what\nwe're saying in effect is that somebody born 82 years ago in\nthe 1940s would live to 82.\nNow the measure, the official life expectancy in the 1940s\nwas actually in the 61,62. So, if somebody's born today,\ntheir true life expectancy is only 82 if we assume that there\nisn't some improvement in mortality rates and longevity\nrates over the coming 82 years.\nAllison Nathan: And in that context, Kevin, when you say\nmortality rates, how do you define that?\nKevin Daly: Mortality rates can be defined many different\nways. But it is the average number of people in a\n\n7\npopulation. And often that's defined under a specific age\ncategory. So, how many 20-year-olds are dying? How many\n30-year-olds are dying in a specific year? And what we're\nseeing, what is driving the increases in life expectancy is\nthat there've been reduced numbers of deaths or\nmortalities for every age group going up until now into the\neighties and nineties.\nAllison Nathan: And so, the assumption that mortality\nrates will remain constant is not bearing out. You're\nactually seeing mortality rates-- less death.\nKevin Daly: Not only is it not bearing out now, but it\nhasn't born out for the past 150 years. Now, that's not true\nfor every country. There are some countries where you are\nseeing, actually, the life expectancy is declining. In the US,\nfor instance, since COVID, there has been a decline in life\nexpectancy. So, it's not good news everywhere in every\ncountry. But on average across the world, there's been this\nconsistent increase in life expectancy that has been taking\nplace for more than 150 years.\nAllison Nathan: Let's talk about the other factor you\nmentioned, declining fertility. How worried should we be\n\n8\nabout that?\nKevin Daly: It's clear that this isn't an unambiguous\npositive in the way that increased longevity will be. I'm long\nenough in this business to remember until a few years ago\nthat people were really worried about exploding population\ngrowth and very excessively rapid population growth. And\nwe have to remind ourselves that even with the falls in\nfertility we have had, is that the global population is still\nprojected to continue to rise.\nSo, the UN on its latest projections expect global\npopulation to rise from 8 billion currently to 10 billion in\n50 years. So, to peak around 2075. And to gradually\ndecline thereafter. They previously projected it would rise to\n11 billion by the end of the century and be continuing to\nrise. So, the projected peak in population has declined. But\nwe're still seeing quite significant population growth over\ntime.\nI think one of the other factors that gives rise to some\nconfusion over this is that the magic number of 2.1 of the\nreplacement rate. So, this is the rate that demographers\ntypically think of if fertility falls below 2.1, the global\n\n9\npopulation in a country or the globe, it will fall. And\nimportantly, we're at that 2.1 percent threshold globally.\nBut actually, that 2.1 percent figure isn't set in stone. That\nis only the replacement rate that stabilizes the population if\nyou have mortality fixed at current levels. If you have life\nexpectancy increasing over time, that replacement rate is\nsignificantly lower. Around 1.5, 1.6. So, actually, we're still\nat a global level, at a level of fertility that implies increased\npopulation growth over time.\nAllison Nathan: So, if I'm putting this all together,\npopulation aging is a consequence, as you said, of\nincreased longevity and declining fertility. Those are the\ntwo major factors. But if we think about population aging\nitself, how big of a problem is that really?\nKevin Daly: I mean, it is a problem. And the reason why\neconomists fret about it so much is because if you have a\nfall in the share of the population that is of working age,\nand if that follows, you know, one for one to a decline in\nemployment rates, then that will reduce employment in\npopulations, will reduce GDP, and will increase\ndependency ratios. So, that the number of dependents in\n\n10\nthe population dependent on those who are in employment.\nSo, if you go back to those figures that we quoted at the\nstart of the podcast, the working age ratio in developed\necosystem falling from 67 at a peak in just before 2000 to\n57, that's a 15 percent decline. If it is matched one for one\nfor a fall in employment, that will reduce employment and\nGDP by a similar amount.\nThe only solution, really in the long term to that increased\nlongevity, increased aging is for us also to work longer.\nOther factors may provide temporary fixes. But the only\nlong-term solution is that if we're living longer, we also\nhave to extend our working lives as well.\nAllison Nathan: So, do we see any evidence that's\nactually happening at this point? Are we working longer as\nwe're getting healthier and staying healthier for longer?\nKevin Daly: We are. That's the good news story to this as\nwell is that this is a problem if we weren't also working\nlonger. But the good news is that we are also working\nlonger. From 2000 in developed economies, longevity has\nincreased on average from 78 years to 82 years. That's a 5\n\n11\npercent increase in longevity. Whereas, effective working\nlives, so the amount using data that we ourselves have\ncalculated, have actually increased by 12 percent over that\nperiod from 34 to 38.\nSo, much as economists treat the working age ratio as\nbeing from 15 to 64, the reality is that people typically\ndon't enter the workplace at 15 because they're in\neducation. And they in many cases don't leave at the age of\n64. And what we're seeing is in their effective work lives,\nthe number of years they actually work, they have\nincreased significantly since 2000.\nAllison Nathan: By the way, I'm not sure everyone would\nagree that's good news, Kevin. I think we do aspire to not\nbe working for a very lengthy amount of time in our lives\nand have some enjoyment at the end there. But if you\nthink about why people are working longer, have you done\nany work in terms of why that is?\nKevin Daly: Yeah. Well, I mean, it's good news in the\nsense that it's an adjustment we have already made. We're\nalready well in the process to making. So, it's not an\nadjustment we have yet to make.\n\n12\nAnd if you look at the factors that have caused the increase\nin effective working lives, I think they are predominantly\ngood factors or positive factors. So, one has been an\nincrease in female participation after childbirth. So, there's\nbeen a significant increase in women extending their\nworking lives, particularly through improvements in\nchildcare provision and so forth, being able to continue in\nthe workforce after they have started having children.\nAnd then the second key factor has been the reduced\nimportance of manual labor. So, manual labor, we think of\nthings like construction, but also manufacturing jobs. A lot\nof manufacturing jobs in particular, these are tough jobs\nthat people typically retire from relatively early. As you've\nseen a reduced share of the workforce in manual jobs,\nyou're seeing an increase in the effective working hours as\na result of that as more and more people are doing office-\ntype jobs.\nAllison Nathan: So, Kevin, we began talking about this,\nthe underlying concern is that we're in this demographic\ntime bomb and that's going to ultimately have negative\nconsequences for economic growth. But what I'm hearing\n\n13\nfrom you is perhaps we don't need to be as concerned\nabout the implications on growth from all of this.\nKevin Daly: I agree. I think one of the factors that\ncontributes to these concerns is that people find it difficult\nto separate the process of getting older, which we all face,\nwhich is inherently worrying, with the process of economic\naging, which is actually less of a concern for society as a\nwhole. Economic transitions are always difficult, but this is\none that we're managing relatively well.\nAllison Nathan: Are there specific investment\nimplications of the work you've done?\nKevin Daly: I think there are. So, a lot of the analysis on\naging and the implication of aging makes the, in my mind,\nmistaken assumption that as our lives increase, we can\nhold everything else fixed. And so, what that implies in\npractice is that we're extending the amount of our lives that\nwe are in, quote/unquote, \"old age.\" I don't think that's an\naccurate description as the IMF work that I had mentioned\nearlier on highlights. Actually, a more accurate description\nis that we're extending each of the parts of our lives. So,\nwe're younger for longer. We're middle aged for longer.\n\n14\nWe're older for longer.\nAnd so, one implication of that is that there's not naturally\ngoing to be a shift from aging necessarily into increased\ndemand for goods and services that, quote unquote, \"old\npeople\" desire because we're extending all stages of our\nlives in proportion.\nAllison Nathan: So, Kevin, what is the bottom line here\nwhen we think about the implications of global aging on\nthe economy? It seems like it's not the concern that people\nmay think it is.\nKevin Daly: Yeah. First point is to say it's to a large sense\nbeen driven by increased life expectancy, which is a good\nthing in its own right, regardless of the economic\nimplications. But even on the economic implications, it's\nthat population aging is only a problem, increased longevity\nis only an issue, if we're not also extending our working\nlives in proportion.\nNow, the good news is not good news for everyone, but the\nreality is that actually across most countries, we have\nalready extended our working lives quite significantly. And\n\n15\nas a result, employment rates have risen, not fallen. And\ndependency ratios have actually declined rather than risen.\nAllison Nathan: Interesting. I think there's a lot of food\nfor thought there, Kevin. Thank you for joining us and\nsharing your insights. Really interesting work you're doing.\nKevin Daly: Thank you, Allison.\nAllison Nathan: This episode of Goldman Sachs\nExchanges was recorded on Thursday, May 29th, 2025. I'm\nAllison Nathan.

So why is that? And is there\na risk that investors have become too complacent? I'm\nAllison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs Exchanges.\nToday, I'm joined by Jan Hatzius, head of Goldman Sachs\nResearch and the firm's chief economist, and Dominic\nWilson, senior advisor in the Global Markets Research\ngroup. Jan, Dom, it's great to have you back on Exchanges\nagain.\nDominic Wilson: Thank you.\n\n2\nJan Hatzius: Look forward to it.\nAllison Nathan: Jan, as I just said, the markets seem\nvery complacent about tariff risk at this point, but a lot is\nstill happening around them. So first, just catch us up.\nWhat's been implemented so far on the tariff front? And\nwhat do you expect to be implemented ahead?\nJan Hatzius: So far, we've seen about a nine\npercentage point increase in the average effective tariff rate\non all US imports, which is composed of 30% China tariffs;\n25% Canada, Mexico, ex-USMCA; 10% on a broad range of\ncountries; and then some sector-specific tariffs, especially\non autos and on steel and aluminum.\nWe're expecting that nine percentage point increase to go to\nsomething like 14 by the end of the year, and we've been in\nthat general vicinity for several months at this point. It\nreally hasn't changed very much, although the details keep\nchanging and are probably going to continue to change.\nOur current expectation is that the five percentage point\nincrement from here is going to be an increase in the sort\nof general baseline rate from 10 to 15, and then we'll also\n\n3\nget some additional sector-specific tariffs on things like\nsemiconductors.\nHowever, in our baseline, we pushed back our expectation\nof pharma tariffs into late next year or early the year, after\nthe mid-term elections. So the latest change has happened\nsort of a wash. So it is a very, very sizable increase in\ntariffs, much bigger than what we expected coming into the\nyear, but somewhat below where we were expecting it in\nearly April and very stable actually in terms of the average\nrate over the last several months.\nAllison Nathan: So the key question remains: What will\nthis all mean for inflation? We got another round of US\ninflation data this week, and it was yet again somewhat\ncooler than expected and that's been the case for several\nmonths now. So will we see a tariff impact on inflation?\nAnd if so, when will we see it?\nJan Hatzius: Yeah, so I'd say on the latest inflation data,\non balance I think they were in line where, if I look at\nwhere our estimate is for core PCE in June, which is what\nall of these CPI, PPI, import price numbers feed into, we're\nat 25 basis points. That's basically what we had coming\n\n4\ninto this set of reports.\nI do think that there's actually more evidence of pass-\nthrough into consumer prices in specific categories that\nyou could reasonably expect to have already been affected\nby tariff increases on China, the first rounds of China\ntariffs that have been in place for a while now; the steel and\naluminum tariffs. So I actually think that is happening,\nbut it's happening gradually, partly because there was a lot\nof inventory building ahead of the tariffs and it's also offset\nin part by still ongoing improvement outside the tariff-\naffected categories. In particular, in services and rents.\nSo our expectation is still that we will see increases in year-\nover-year core PCE inflation from the sort of mid- to high-\ntwo's, where we've been for quite a while now, to the low\nthree's. That's still our view. However, I also think that\nmost likely this is a price level effect. A little bit like a\nvalue-added tax increase that we've seen in Europe many\ntimes that boosts inflation meaningfully for a period of\ntime, 12 months, and then it drops out. And I think that\nwhat we've seen on inflation expectations, especially\nlonger-term inflation expectations, supports that over the\npast several months.\n\n5\nAllison Nathan: And there's also some impact on growth\nfrom these tariffs. What are your expectations at this\npoint?\nJan Hatzius: Some of the ways in which tariffs affect\ngrowth have proven to be I think definitely less dramatic.\nWe're seeing less of an uncertainty impact that's clearly\nvisible in the data. And in fact, some of the uncertainty\nmeasures have come down. Of course, so far we haven't\nseen a huge real income hit either because we're still in the\nearly stages of the pass through. So you could say that\nwhat we're learning here is that this is not such a big deal.\nOn the other hand, actual growth in the first half of 2025\nactually has been pretty soft. Right now, we're estimating\nfirst half GDP growth only 1.2% on average. You have to\ntake Q1 and Q2 together because of the massive front-\nloading distortions in the quarterly numbers, but I think\nthe half year as a whole is a more reasonable perspective.\nSo it does seem that growth actually has slowed a\nsubstantial amount, in part because of tariffs, maybe in\npart because of other things that are harder to identify.\n\n6\nWe've also seen a slowdown in employment growth. Private\nsector employment growth has come down meaningfully. It\nwas well below 100,000 in the June numbers, in fact, the\nADP numbers which I think deserve some weight. That's\nthe private payroll processor figure was even weaker than\nthat. So it does seem that we're on a slower growth pace.\nWe're still expecting 1 to 1.5% growth in 2025 as a whole.\nI would say that some of the forward-looking soft\nindicators, survey indicators, have looked a little bit better.\nSo consistent with maybe some stabilization. But it's a\nslower growth year without much doubt.\nAllison Nathan: Dominic, let me turn to you. Jan just said\nwe have seen some meaningful slowing in growth, and of\ncourse tariff risks are still very much with us. Yet the\nmarkets are at very strong levels, especially equity market\nin particular. Has that been surprising at all, the market\nreaction in general to these recent developments?\nDominic Wilson: It's pretty striking. I think it's getting\nless surprising over time. I feel like really this is a theme --\nwe're reinforcing it -- but it's a theme that's been going on\nsince mid-April, which is that the markets essentially\n\n7\nmoved to a position where they feel like they know some\nweakness is coming in the economy. I think people expect\nthe tariffs to have impact. But as Jan said, as the kind of\nparameters have become clearer, we've had this sort of high\nbut fairly stable expected tariff outcome for a while, I think\npeople have just got more comfortable that this is going to\nbe a meaningful one-off adjustment but that you're not\ngoing to have a kind of extended period of weakness. And\nthen people essentially, particularly I think in the equity\nmarket, feel comfortable extending their horizon, looking\nthrough that weakness, and anchoring more on the\nmedium-term growth picture.\nI think it is striking again this latest sort of escalation in\nthe renewed kind of tariff letters coming around definitely\nhaven't shaken that confidence at all on the growth side. It\nis striking, if you look across different markets and you\nmentioned that equities in particular have been relaxed, if\nyou look at inflation markets, we have priced over the last\nfew weeks I think a recognition that tariffs are going to go\nup. The market's pricing more near-term inflation, so it's\nnot that the market is discounting that completely but I\nthink it is much less worried about the kind of growth and\nrisk consequences of that.\n\n8\nAnd I think, again, there are sort of three basic\nassumptions that the market's making around that. The\nfirst is there's a sort of modest expectation that things will\nget dialed back and resolved. I think the fact that you're\nseeing inflation pricing rise suggests it's not mostly about\nthat. The market does think more tariffs are probably\ncoming, but I do think there's been the greater sense that\nadjustments will be made if problems arise.\nThe second, which is what Jan referenced, is that I do\nthink the worst of the economic impacts just look less\nvisible. We're clearly seeing weakness, but we're not seeing\nall of the weakness that perhaps people worried we might\nsee initially. Financial conditions tightening has reversed.\nThe uncertainty impacts, as Jan said, are smaller. So I\nthink there's just a general sense that the kind of deeper\ntail risks and economic tail risks are not as troubling.\nAnd I would say the third is just this general notion that\nthe market doesn't really need to believe that there won't be\nan impact from tariffs; they just need to believe that it's not\ngoing to be a sustained impact if we have some quarters of\nweakness as we adjust to this new regime, but life goes on\n\n9\non the other side of that and growth returns, which is more\nor less the flavor of our forecast. That's something I think\nwhere the market can get broadly comfortable.\nIt does point -- you know, you asked about complacency. I\nthink that's probably too strong, but it points to where the\nvulnerability lies in that in terms of those assumptions.\nThose assumptions are not that different from our central\ncase, but anything that shakes that idea that you can\nplausibly look through the weakness, anything that raises\nthe fear again that something recessionary is on the\nhorizon or that we might have to worry about, a kind of\nmore dramatic shift in the economic outlook, you know,\ncracks in the labor market. Things we haven't really seen\nyet but are still an ongoing risk. That's where I think the\nmarket will find itself from this current position vulnerable.\nBut if we don't touch that then I think we're going to\ncontinue to look forward to the medium-term picture and\nanchor on that.\nAllison Nathan: I think we'll probably come back to that\nin this conversation, but let me hit on some of the other big\ndevelopments that have happened since we last spoke, one\nof which, Jan, of course is Trump's fiscal package, the Big\n\n10\nBeautiful Act has passed. And there was so much build-up\nto that passage. What will be the implications though?\nWill it move the needle at all on growth?\nJan Hatzius: It's going to have a positive impact on near-\nterm growth taken by itself because it is fiscally\nexpansionary. The tax cuts are bigger than the spending\ncuts, and the tax cuts also arrive more quickly than the\nspending cuts. And so that's fiscally stimulative in early\n2026, probably to the tune of a few tenths of a percentage\npoint, maybe as much as half a percentage point. But it\ndoesn't include the tariff impact. And if you look at it from\na revenue perspective, it is actually a bit more neutral once\nthe tariff impact is included, and I think the growth effects\nultimately are going to be offset by the tariff effect.\nSo we haven't really made major changes on the back of\nthis. We also haven't made major changes to our deficit\nprojections. We still think that we're on track for 6% of\nGDP federal deficits pretty much as far as the eye can see,\nor at least until there's a more sustained effort to\nconsolidate the budget outlook. Six percent of GDP is a big\nnumber. It means a large primary deficit, ex-interest\ndeficit, of maybe 3% of GDP, and that probably means\n\n11\nongoing increases in the debt-to-GDP ratio, again, pretty\nmuch as far as the eye can see. And that's a reason -- and\nwe may come back to this -- also for longer-term term\npremia, the amount of compensation that investors\ndemand for holding long-term treasuries for those term\npremia to probably edge up over time.\nSo the fiscal outlook remains concerning. We're certainly\nnot in the camp that there's a fiscal crisis coming any time\nin the near term, but over time I do think the risk that you\nhave, these sort of mini crises -- and we've seen some of\nthis again and again over the last several years -- I think\nthat risk does go up.\nAllison Nathan: So if I listen to what you're saying about\nthese recent developments, basically growth is continuing\nbut at a relatively slower pace. Inflation is set to rise a bit\nfrom here but really looking at a one-off effect. What is the\nimplication of all this for the Fed? You started to mention\nterm premium. What are your Fed expectations at this\npoint?\nJan Hatzius: We're at a level of short-term interest rates\nthat is above basically anybody's estimate of where the\n\n12\nFunds Rate will be in the long term, the nature rate of\ninterest, or however you want to call it. Most people have\nthat somewhere in the low threes, maybe low to mid-\nthrees. We're now in the low to mid-fours. So it's a\nquestion of when that adjustment comes in a broadly\nneutral economic environment.\nOur expectation is that they're going to start moving down\nin September. We have a 25 basis point cut in September.\nWe've got two more cuts at the subsequent two meetings.\nAnd then another 50 basis points in total in 2026 to get\nyou down to the low threes. And the timing of this is\ndriven by really news on when they're going to be\nsufficiently confident that this really is a one-off inflation\neffect. And I think sometime September is a reasonable\ntime frame.\nI think there's very little chance that anything happens in\nJuly, so almost by definition that means the risks through\nSeptember are on the later side. It could be a little bit\nlater, but this is our current baseline.\nAllison Nathan: Dom, let me ask you what the rates\nmarkets are making of all this. We have discussed\n\n13\ninflation risk, fiscal risk, there is another risk that's been\nvery much in focus this week, the change in Fed leadership\nthat is upcoming and the potential to potentially have a\nnew Fed chair that is doveish leaning. So how is the rates\nmarket digesting all of this?\nDominic Wilson: As I've said, we've seen some\nswinging backwards and forwards coming off the tariff\nfears. Initially April into May, we had one of those rounds\nof worries that Jan mentioned about bond markets and\nyields went up a lot at the back end of the yield curve.\nThen we got some meaningful relaxation after that helped\nby some of the better inflation news. We had FOMC\nmembers starting to talk about maybe cutting rates more\nquickly and some sort of excitement about the possibility of\nan earlier easing. And I think the resilience of the job\nmarket in particular and just general data since then has\nblunted those hopes a bit, so now we're shifting back\ntowards dialing back some of that optimism.\nAs Jan said, we're pricing September a little bit over a 50%\nchance. As Jan said, there are still lots of ways. I think\nit's easy to see how the case for cuts opens up and opens\nup more quickly again. In particular, as I said, the market\n\n14\nis pricing a higher inflation track now than the forecast\nthat we have. And so if you combine that with relatively\ngood growth pricing, it's easy to see how there's a little bit\nmore softness in the data on the growth or labor market\nside. And certainly if the inflation news continues to track\nwell that the Fed's going to, as they've been signaling, step\noff from talking about easing to actually doing it.\nSo our general view has been, as the market winds back\nit's sort of expectations of easing with a view like Jan and\nthe team's, you should start to push back against the front\nend of the yield curve.\nI think the story for the longer end of the yield curve is in\nsome ways a little bit the other way around. Jan\nmentioned as well the fiscal position is we're not worried\nabout imminent crisis, but you have a lot of supply to be\ndigested still. You have an economy that is functioning\nwith reasonable growth, and what we're seeing is these sort\nof periodic upward pressure, this periodic upward pressure\non longer-dated yields. And I think without meaningful\neconomic weakness, it's going to be hard to pull back a lot\naway from those levels. And on that side of things, I think\nour view is that it's the opposite way around. That if\n\n15\nthere's meaningful relief in yields then you should probably\nget ready for things to drift back up.\nImplicit in that is a view that the yield curve will steepen,\nthat the front's more likely to go down relative to the back.\nAnd that's been what's happening. And I think that's an\nongoing trend.\nYou mentioned the Fed chair. That is coming. I would say\nat least in the market discussions, people have moved on\nfrom the fiscal debate now the bill has become an act, and\nthe Fed chair discussion is more prominently in focus.\nAnd we've seen obviously sort of market movement around\nsome of the kind of rumors and announcements around\nthat. I do think that's something where the risk of\nsomeone who might push more actively for easier monetary\npolicy is something that would probably reinforce that\nstepping dynamic in yield curves and probably also\ncontribute to some further pressure on the dollar, which is\nthe pattern that we've seen when those issues have\ntemporarily entered the market.\nAllison Nathan: Jan, how real do you think that risk is,\nthat we are looking at a Fed leadership that might lean\n\n16\ndovish because that is clearly what the administration\nwants?\nJan Hatzius: I think over time, I do think that the\nadministration is going to be able to make of course several\nFed appointments. And my expectation is that there will be\nan orderly transition, and that's the latest I think turn that\nthe president has said. But yeah, my expectation is there\nwill be a new Fed chair. I don't know who it's going to be,\nbut I think it's going to be in May 2026.\nThere are three appointments to the board of governors\nthat President Trump is probably going to make. There are\n19 people around the table. There are 12 voters at any one\ntime, so there's a lot of institutional stability. And the Fed\nchair of course has a very important role in shaping the\ndiscussion and setting the agenda and working with the\nstaff, but there's still a broader structure and a broader set\nof people. So I don't think it's going to be a dramatic shift\nin terms of actual policy setting that we're going to see over\nthe next year.\nI think it's still going to be driven by the economic data and\nthe collective wisdom that Fed officials bring or the\n\n17\ncollective views and analysis of the data. I don't think it's\ngoing to be a massive shift.\nAnd independence of monetary policy is very important.\nWe've written some things about it this year, and I would\nsay there was more concern around the possibility that the\npresident gets the ability to remove Fed officials without\ncause before the Supreme Court decision that basically\ncarved out the Fed from the president's ability to make\nthose kinds of changes. But I do take the Supreme Court\ndecision as an affirmation of the importance of independent\nmonetary policy.\nAllison Nathan: Interesting. Let's turn to the dollar\nbecause, while US equities have more than recovered from\nthe April Liberation Day drop, the dollar has not. Jan, you\nrecently said that the dollar is the dog that didn't bark.\nWhat did you mean by that?\nJan Hatzius: I meant that concerns about the US economy\nhave receded. Expectations of relative US economic\nperformance are not as negative as they were in April when\nwe thought that it was basically a knife-edge case whether\nwe were going to have a recession. And in fact, for a very\n\n18\nbrief period of two hours on April 9th, we had a recession\nforecast. But it seemed very touch and go.\nThings have stabilized for a variety of reasons that we've\ndiscussed, but nevertheless, on net, the dollar has\ncontinued to depreciate. And I think that drives home that\nthe dollar depreciation is driven not just by the cyclical ups\nand downs of the near-term growth outlook but also really\ndriven by several longer term factors, some of which we've\ndiscussed. But the dollar is still very highly valued on a\nraw trade weight basis, and that historically sets up for\ndepreciation in coming years.\nThe US still runs a very large current account deficit that\nneeds to be financed by equal sized capital inflows. And\nthen I think there are some of these more tail risk concerns\naround things like Fed independence that probably also\nhave an impact on how foreign investors perceive the\ninvestments in the US. All of these things are happening at\nthe margin. This is something that our team, Dom,\nKamakshya Trivedi, and team have really emphasized that\nthis is not about a fire sale. It's about making it a little bit\nmore difficult to obtain the capital inflows that are needed\nto cover the current account deficit, and all of these prices\n\n19\nare ultimately set at the margin. And I think what we're\nseeing in price action is that these effects are coming\nthrough.\nAllison Nathan: So Dom, do you think that dollar\nweakness has much further to run at this point?\nDominic Wilson: Yeah, the general view is that it does,\nand for exactly the reasons that Jan mentioned. That\nstructurally there are a lot of these forces in place that\ntraditionally have led to fairly extended periods of dollar\nrealignment. And if you look at where we started from in\nterms of valuation, if you look at where people are in that\nreallocation and those hedging decisions, we think we're\nprobably in the middle of that process rather than at the\nend.\nYou know, it gets more complicated as time goes on, I think\npartly because dollar weakness is now a pretty well-\naccepted story. It's always better when you feel like\nsomething or believe something that other people don't yet\nbelieve. I think the nature of the dollar weakening trend\nhas changed; we're deeper into that cycle.\n\n20\nWe've talked in other contexts across markets about\nkeeping the faith, and I think that the story now more is\nthat confidence that this is a process that still has room to\ngo. And that when it gets challenged temporary for some of\nkind of the cyclical reasons that come up from time to time\nthat you should not give up your confidence that the\nstory's going to extend. And I think we're having a little bit\nof that at the moment.\nAs Jan said, the big picture story is that, despite a lot of\nrelief about the US economy, in the second quarter the\ndollar continued depreciating even after the reversal in a lot\nof other asset markets. But just over the last couple of\nweeks, as we've got better growth news in the US, as we've\ndialed back some of that kind of Fed expectation with\npeople already fairly heavily positioned, we're getting a little\nbit more dollar support again. And you can see people's\nconfidence in the theme even though it's something that\npeople are quite heavily subscribed to, you can see that\nconfidence waning. We're getting a lot more kind of\nincoming questions about whether the shifts are done.\nAnd I think that it is one of those moments where in some\nsense what's distinctive about the view now is that belief\nthat we're probably midway through a more extended\n\n21\nadjustment to deal with some of those kind of flow\nimbalances that Jan talked about. And that that doesn't\nstop some ebb and flow through the course of these things.\nWe had a very long dollar depreciation in 2002 to 2005 and\nthen beyond that. And there were definitely periods where\nthe dollar strengthened. But when you step back and look\nat the broader trend, it's a kind of sustained depreciation\nstory I think. And unless something changes very\ndramatically to reinforce the US sort of exceptionalism\ntheme again, I think that's the environment we're in. So…\nAllison Nathan: I did want to ask you about that\nbecause I struggle to find a view that is more of a\nconsensus view than the soft dollar view at this moment.\nSo I was going to ask you if that gave you pause.\nDominic Wilson: Yeah. The answer is I think it makes it\nmore complicated. It means you're more likely to have\nthese sort of moments of challenge. And as I said, then\nwhat becomes distinctive is continuing to hold your view or\nadd to your view or retain that commitment as other people\nbecome more nervous about it. But it definitely increases\nthe chance that there's a bit more back and forth.\n\n22\nAllison Nathan: Right. So Jan, when you think about\nthe second half of the year, recap your expectations for the\nUS but really globally what are your expectations for\ngrowth?\nJan Hatzius: Not too much change. So a reasonably fairly\nsubdued growth pace. For example, in Europe, we don't\nexpect a lot of growth sequentially in the second half of the\nyear. Although I would say that in general European\ngrowth has come in a little bit ahead of expectations for\nseveral quarters now, and there are some reasons to think\nthat some of this borrowed growth, it was a front-loading\nboost. I mean, I think a real front-loading boost in some\nUS partner economies because there was a desire to\nimport, and that benefited the European industrial sector.\nSo second half of the year I think could be pretty soft in\nterms of sequential GDP growth, but we still think we're in\na kind of 1% environment for the euro area. We're\nprobably seeing a pretty sizable fiscal boost in Germany\nover the next couple of years, so we think 1.5, maybe close\nto 2% growth for a period of time. The challenges for the\nGerman economy from industrial structure competition\n\n23\nwith China, energy costs, all of those structural challenges\nare definitely still there but with the much more\nexpansionary fiscal policy that's providing a lift, and that's\nalso visible to a lesser degree in the euro area as a whole.\nSimilarly, I'd say China, China continues to be an economy\nwith a very strong industrial sector that continues to\nupgrade and a still challenged domestic sector.\nDemographics are bad. The hope that housing would end\nits long slide that I heard quite a lot about a couple of\nmonths ago, those have again given way to disappointment.\nThe latest house price numbers have been quite weak, so\nit's a very bimodal economy. Our overall forecast for GDP\ngrowth in China continues to be basically 4.5 or a little bit\nmore than 4.5%, which is effectively where we've been all\nyear with a short period where we thought it was going to\nbe four or less when you had these sky-high US tariffs.\nBut what we've found is that the Chinese industrial sector\nhas been remarkably able to deal with the ups and downs\nof US tariffs, even during the highest US tariff levels.\nOverall exports from China didn't really decline. The\nexports to the US declined. The exports to the US are still\ndown somewhere in the mid 20% range. But nevertheless,\n\n24\noverall exports in the goods producing sector in general\ncontinues to be pretty resilient.\nAllison Nathan: Interesting. So if you think about the\nsecond half of the year, what risks are you most focused on\nthat could derail some of your views?\nJan Hatzius: There is of course a big tariff deadline. There\npotentially are going to be more tariff deadlines. We're\nfocused on August 1st. There is the 30% Europe threat.\nThere is a 30-35% Canada, Mexico, ex-USMCA threat.\nThere is a number of other threats out there. We're\nbuilding that into our forecast to a much more limited\nextent. We have a 15% baseline tariff up from ten. But of\ncourse, it's possible that these things actually take effect\nthe way that the reciprocal tariffs, the full reciprocal tariffs\ntook effect, albeit only for a few hours, on April 9th. So\nthat's risk number one.\nThe Fed chair discussion is going to continue. We're going\nto learn more in the next several months. Probably there's\ngoing to be a candidate that will have been identified even if\nthe removing Chair Powell concerns come and go, even if\nthat isn't where we go. We will learn more about who the\n\n25\nnext Fed chair is, and I think that's going to have a\nsignificant impact. Those would be, from a US perspective,\nprobably the top two things on my agenda.\nAllison Nathan: And Dom, I think the question we all get\nis: What could shake these equity markets from these\nhighs? So what are your biggest worries there?\nDominic Wilson: Yeah, look, I think there are a lot of\nthings that could provide local challenges with pricing and\ninflation growth in a pretty friendly way, as we discussed\nbefore. We're looking through the some of the tariff threats\nand treating those as manageable. You know, lots of\nthings that could cause some local wobbles.\nI think in terms of more serious challenges, the primary\none -- and not to be too reductive -- I think the list\nnarrows. If you look back over the last 12 months and you\nthink we've had two big equity drawdowns and sort of\nvolatility events, one in August 2024 and one in April 2025.\nAnd what they both have in common is that they were\nheavily focused around, like, real fear that a recession was\ncoming. And I think what we're learning is that's the\nbiggest source of risk for deeper vulnerability in equities. If\n\n26\nthe market thinks the unemployment rate is set to rise\nproperly in a way that we really haven't seen for a while,\nthat is the sort of thing I think we've seen visibly creates a\nlot of risk aversion and creates a lot of worry, particularly\nfrom this sort of very benign level of pricing.\nAllison Nathan: Right. And of course, we are not\nexpecting a recession.\nDominic Wilson: So we're not expect -- so I would\nsay it's a tail risk, it's an important tail risk, but that is\nobviously not the baseline view.\nAllison Nathan: So given that baseline view, what are\nyour key messages for investors right now?\nDominic Wilson: So I would say, echoing the things\nthat we've said, there are probably four things. The first is\nthere are some structural things that we think are trends\nthat are going on now that we think are going to continue,\ndollar weakness being one of the key ones. That pressure\ntowards a sort of steepening of the yield curve. Perhaps\nsomewhat lower yields at the front end of the yield curve\nand this periodic testing of yields higher at the back end.\n\n27\nAnd one of the things which we haven't talked about here\nbut, you know, our commodities team has been very\nconsistent about is over the medium term move lower in oil\nprices over time and the skew of risks lying in that\ndirection. So those are longer term structural stories that\nwe think are going to have ups and downs but we have\nreasonably high confidence will continue to be things that\nplay out over the coming months.\nThe second thing I would say is that broad macro backdrop\non our baseline forecast is still fairly friendly for risk\nmarkets. We're pricing things well. There's less room than\nthere was, but it's still a reasonably benign story given that\nyou're not going to trigger that recession fear along that\ntrack. We've said and we think there's still value in\ndiversifying US equity holdings, probably more value than\nthere has been at some point in the past. They\nunderperformed in the first quarter, they outperformed in\nthe second quarter, and we've said that non-US investors\nshould think about hedging their currency exposure on\ntheir US equities. But there are still unique exposures in\nthe US market, particularly around AI, that people are\ngoing to be enthusiastic to have, and so it's not a case of\n\n28\nbacking away from US equities at all. And I think it's just\nabout broad equity story. Still looks like it has some\nsupport from the macro.\nThe third, which we just talked about, is that big tail risk is\naround recession for me. So I think if the unemployment\nrate ticks up, that's the thing you need to worry about. It's\na tail, but that's the tail that you need to worry about. I\nthink to an extent, shorter-dated bonds but bonds in\ngeneral should be somewhat protective of that risk, but\nthat's an area where people need to feel like they're at least\naware of the risks they're taking and their portfolio is\nstructured in a way that makes them comfortable with\nthat.\nAnd I think the final one, which is a sort of newer thing, is\nthat we have seen more of these episodes of sort of less\ncommon institutional concerns around fiscal sustainability,\naround monetary independence, things like that, where\nwe've seen dollar weakness, bond weakness, equity\nweakness together. That hasn't been a long-lasting theme,\nbut I do think, again, those are deeper tail risks. But\nhaving some awareness of the possibility, that possibility is\na higher possibility than you would normally say. And so\n\n29\nwhen you look at the book that you have, the portfolio that\nyou have, just to be comfortable that you're not taking too\nmuch accumulative exposure to something jointly like that\nhappening, which is not something we've seen as much of\nover the prior years.\nAllison Nathan: So a lot to focus on.\nDominic Wilson: There's always a lot to focus on.\nAllison Nathan: I always enjoy these conversations.\nThank you so much, Jan and Dom, and I would say good\nluck to investors out there. Thank you again, Jan and\nDom, for joining us.\nJan Hatzius: Thanks for having us.\nDominic Wilson: Yeah, thank you.\nAllison Nathan: This episode was recorded on Thursday,\nJuly 17th.

So, what's the outlook\nfrom here? I'm Allison Nathan, and this is Goldman Sachs\nExchanges. For today's episode, I'm speaking with my\ncolleague in Goldman Sachs Research, Daan Struyven, co-\nhead of Global Commodities Research and head of Oil\nResearch, to talk about how recent events, notably the\nMiddle East conflict and evolving tariff policies, are\naffecting the broader commodity and economic landscape.\nDaan, welcome back to the program.\nDaan Struyven: Thanks, Allison.\n\n2\nAllison Nathan: So, let's start with oil. I think the\nobvious place to start. Oil prices have been very volatile\namid these recent developments in the Middle East, but I\nthink what's most striking to me is how quickly they\nactually retreated from the recent highs. And they're still\nat lower levels than I think many people would have\nexpected given the recent developments. So why is this?\nDaan Struyven: Yeah, absolutely. So we estimate that\nthe geopolitical risk premium in oil spiked to over $15 per\nbarrel on Sunday night, just a week ago. And then 24\nhours later, it was just worth only a couple of dollars per\nbarrel, based on the fact that oil prices were nearly back to\npre-escalation levels and also if you look at options\nmarkets. If you look at options markets and look at the\nprobability of large supply disruptions, pretty low, as\nestimated by options markets. Below 4% or so.\nAnd the question is: Why is that? I think the first reason\nis that oil traders have now experienced several episodes\nwith major geopolitical shocks with actual no disruptions\nto oil flows, with barrels still flowing. I think the second\nreason is that Iran's response was quite muted. Both the\nUS and Qatar got a heads up and there were no damages.\n\n3\nThird, I think both the US and China have very big\nincentives to make sure that oil flows continue, in\nparticularly through the Strait of Hormuz. And President\nTrump, with his great focus on energy affordability in\nparticular, he's super focused on preventing those\ndisruptions. And then last but not least, I think a lot of\ntraders are reluctant to position for sharp price upside as\nthey share a view that the markets will start to see large\ninventory builds from the fall onwards.\nAllison Nathan: Right. So, a lot of forces working in the\nopposite direction. But just to be clear, if we were to see an\nescalation of tensions, what would the upside look like?\nDaan Struyven: Yeah, so the last few weeks are a\nreminder that geopolitics can cause potentially very\nsignificant price upside if we were to see actual\ndisruptions. To be clear, our base case assumes no\ndisruptions, but we estimate that crude could spike above\n$90 per barrel if Iran's supply were to drop sharply. And in\nan extreme tail scenario where the Strait of Hormuz were to\nbe disrupted for a sustained basis, oil prices could spike\nabove $110 per barrel. To be clear, we think these are tail\nscenarios. But, yeah, geopolitical situations currently are\n\n4\nnot necessarily in a stable equilibrium, so we'll keep\nwatching the geopolitical risks.\nAllison Nathan: Right. So that is the upside tale.\nUpside in terms of prices. Maybe downside in terms of the\nglobal economy. But even beyond that really extreme\nscenario, do you see any lasting consequences from what\nhas ultimately been this 12-day war in terms of the\ncommodity markets?\nDaan Struyven: I think it was definitely scary for\ninvestors and policymakers going through it. At some\npoint, if you looked at the Polymarket prediction market,\nthe probability of a disruption of the Strait of Hormuz\nspiked to 60% at some point. And I do think that\npolicymakers, especially in China, will likely double down\non diversifying their supply of energy. In practice, that\nmeans good thing to invest in power, electrifying the\neconomy, coal as well. Basically, boost the supply of\neverything that you have at home.\nChina continues to import about two thirds of its oil\nconsumption from the rest of the world, and about 50% of\nits imports are coming from the strait. So I think this is\n\n5\ngoing to strengthen this key trend of diversifying away from\nforeign oil and gas imports for the Chinese economy, which\nis bearish oil and gas but bullish for copper and some of\nthe other green metals.\nAllison Nathan: And in general, if you think about the\nprospect of a big disruption, are you seeing oil producers\nbroadly looking to increase supplies that were not as\nvulnerable? We've already seen that trend, have we not? I\nmean, what are you observing in terms of the oil supply\ntrends amid these types of developments?\nDaan Struyven: Yeah, so the main reason we look for oil\nprices to drop by another $10 per barrel over the next year\nis that we expect strong supply growth. In fact, we expect\nglobal supply this year to grow four times more quickly\nthan demand, assuming no disruptions, with strong supply\ngrowth basically from two buckets of countries -- the\nOPEC-plus producers that are unwinding their voluntary\nproduction cuts and then what we call non-OPEC, ex-US\nshale countries such as Brazil, Guyana, Norway,\nKazakhstan, that are actually raising production by a\nmillion barrels per day between August and last month. So\nvery rapid supply increases there.\n\n6\nAnd there's actually I think upside risk to our forecast that\nUS shale supply will decline modestly. Our base case looks\nfor declines because we look for lower prices, but the recent\nspike I think has allowed many producers to sell forward\ntheir production at a higher price, to hedge price risk. And\nwhen we speak to some of the producers, they're a little bit\nless pessimistic about the oil price outlook from their\nperspective than, for instance, in early April. And in fact,\nwe got an all-time high for US crude supply released earlier\ntoday for the month of April. So, I think this reinforces our\nview that supply growth will be strong and will push down\noil prices, assuming you get no geopolitical surprise.\nAllison Nathan: Well, I was just going to ask you about\nthat because, relative to the last decade, oil prices aren't\nparticularly high right now, but producers are saying\nthey're somewhat optimistic. They've hedged at slightly\nhigher prices. And so ultimately, this price is economic to\nmotivate the supply growth you're seeing.\nDaan Struyven: Yeah. So we expect supply growth\nglobal this year to be driven by long cycle producers that\nhave very low variable costs in contrast to US shale where\n\n7\nthe variable costs are quite high and where we look for\nmodest declines perhaps with the risk of flat production\nbased on the recently stronger numbers. The big picture of\nthe last ten years have been an era where US shale has\ndriven 100% of global supply growth, and I think our\nforecast is that '25 and '26 are going to be a partial, but\nonly very partial, reversal of that trend. But US shale\nsupply declining modestly because we expect lower prices.\nAnd with countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE\nregaining market share.\nAllison Nathan: So supply substantially outpacing\ndemand, but let's talk a little bit more about demand\nbecause one of the other striking aspects of the last few\nweeks has been the incredible heat wave that we've been\nexperiencing here in the US as well as in Europe. What are\nthe implications of that on demand?\nDaan Struyven: Yeah, so the heat waves we are\nexperiencing in the US, in Europe, now in China are\nbullish for energy prices, both because it means higher\ncooling demands via AC and because it could also\npotentially disrupt supply of some of the oil refined\nproducts, for instance. It can be tough for refineries to run\n\n8\nwith those very hot temperatures.\nWe think that the most significant upside is in power\nprices, including summer big power prices in the US. And\nto a lesser extent, it could be also be positive for natural\ngas prices or coal prices. And to a lesser extent, fuel oil,\nwhich is the part of the oil barrel that is used for cooling.\nWe do think that US summer power markets are getting\nvery tight. And following the blackout we see in late April\nin Spain, we do think that some of the tighter US power\nmarkets -- for instance, the mid-Atlantic market -- is at the\nsignificant risk of power price spikes and perhaps even\noutages. The reason is that power demand is now growing\nquickly, more quickly than GDP, in sharp contrast with the\nlast two decades. Data centers are part of that. And on\nthe supply side, most of the supply growth is really coming\nfrom weather-dependent supply such as solar and wind,\nand we're also having a lot of coal retirements being\nscuttled. So in other words, the summer power market is\ngetting critically tight, and we do think that outages are a\nsignificant risk.\nAllison Nathan: Interesting. And we think about beyond\n\n9\nthese weather-related risks, we're entering the summer\ntravel season here in the US in particular. How does that\nimpact demand? Again, it's interesting to me that demand\nis falling so far behind supply.\nDaan Struyven: Yeah, so seasonally, oil demand is going\nto be strong in July and August. Those tend to be the\nstrongest months both because of cooling demand and\nbecause of travel demand. But taking a step back from the\nseasonals, I would characterize oil demand growth as\npretty modest compared to history and modest compared\nto strong demand growth were seeing in some of the other\ncommodities like copper. So specifically, we expect global\noil demand to grow by 600 KBD this year. That is 0.6% of\nthe overall market. Contrast that with the 4-5% demand\ngrowth we see in global power markets. Compare it with\ncopper demand in China that's up 25% year to date with\nsurges in solar installations and electrification supporting\ndemand. So, I think divergence is a key theme that we're\nseeing, especially within China commodity markets, but\nmore broadly on the demand side across the markets.\nAllison Nathan: But economic growth it’s slowing, as I\nsaid at the beginning but it's still holding up relatively well.\n\n10\nSo why are we seeing such subdued growth for oil? Is it\njust becoming less energy-intensive growth?\nDaan Struyven: Yes. I think traditionally GDP growth\nwas maybe 1.5 percentage points faster than oil demand\ngrowth as, for instance, vehicles became more fuel efficient.\nBut we do think that oil demand in China has peaked.\nChina oil demand used to grow by 500, 600 KBD in the five\nyears before the pandemic. But the very rapid shifting out\nof gasoline and diesel into electric-powered cars, into LNG-\npowered trucks, and now even into electric trucks is\ncausing China oil demand to stagnate and is now causing a\nwider gap between GDP growth and global oil demand\ngrowth. Perhaps the new normal for that gap is around 2.5\npercentage points or so.\nAllison Nathan: Interesting. Let's pivot a little bit and\ntalk about the other commodity that's gotten a lot of\nattention, been a big outperformer this year: Gold. Gains\nhave recently consolidated, but gold prices are still up 25%\nyear to date. Are you still bullish gold? And if so, why? Is\nthis a cyclical story? It's a structural story? What's driving\nthe bullishness?\n\n11\nDaan Struyven: Yeah, we're still bullish. We still expect\nthe gold price to rise to $4,000 per troy ounce, so that's\nanother 20% of upside for here. The main reason is really\nstructurally higher demand from central banks. Central\nbank buying of gold has increased five-fold since '22 when\nRussia's central bank reserves got frozen. And we just got\nthe survey a couple of months ago surveying more than 70\ncentral banks across the world, and the survey showed\nrecord high purchase intentions with no central bank that\nwas surveyed indicating that they would reduce their gold\nholdings over the next 12 months.\nAllison Nathan: So interesting. So, it's central banks\ndiversifying, and they're diversifying out of the dollar, right?\nOr where are they diversifying from? Dollar-based assets?\nDaan Struyven: Yes, primarily. Yeah.\nAllison Nathan: And that's interesting because if we\nthink about a structurally weaker dollar and lower interest\nrates ahead, which I think is the consensus expectations\nand certainly our expectations, particularly on the dollar\nside, what does that mean for commodities demand for gold\nbut even beyond?\n\n12\nDaan Struyven: Yeah, so I think the big potential winner\nfrom further dollar diversification is gold. But more\nbroadly, I think the industrial metals could benefit from\nlower rates and a weaker dollar.\nOn gold specifically, the almost doubling in price since '22\nhas really been driven by central banks diversifying out of\nthe dollar. But the next giant leap for gold markets could\nbe private investors, who often feel like they're\noverallocated to the dollar, may reallocate to some extent\nout of dollar holdings into gold, and that could be the next\ngiant leap for gold markets because the gold market is 200\ntimes smaller than the US S&P 500. It's 100 times smaller\nthan the US treasury market. So, you only need, like, a\nvery small shift of flows into the much smaller gold market\nto cause very significant gold price upside.\nMore broadly, I think to know which commodity would\nbenefit from lower rates and a weaker dollar, I think you\nhave to think about the drivers. Are you in a risk-off\nenvironment where the dollar and rates are weakening\nbecause market participants are worried about US\nrecession or about US fiscal sustainability? Then I think\n\n13\ngold is your winner. If you're more in a risk-on\nenvironment where the dollar is perhaps weakening\nbecause of European stimulus or perhaps because you see\na dovish pivot in the Fed reaction function, then we find\ntypically that industrial metals such as copper and\naluminum are the biggest winners.\nAllison Nathan: Okay. Lots to think about there. The\nother big wild cards of course out there right now are trade\nuncertainty and fiscal uncertainty. We are still facing this\nlooming July 9th tariff deadline. Been a lot of back and\nforth about what will happen on, before, even after that\ndate. So how are tariffs reshaping the commodities\nlandscape? Where do you stand now in terms of their\nimpact on prices ahead?\nDaan Struyven: Yeah, so I think I want to distinguish\nbetween the macro impact from higher tariffs on other\nthings than commodities -- for instance, the reciprocal\ntariffs -- on GDP commodity demand and commodity\nprices, and then the impact of tariffs on metals specifically.\nSo far, I think the macro impact via weaker GDP of tariffs\nis still not very large based on what we can see. Still\n\n14\nmanageable. Perhaps because financial conditions have\nweathered the tariffs in position well. Perhaps because\ntrade policy uncertainty measures are normalizing. But\nperhaps because it's still too early to see the full effect. I\nthink there has been a lot of frontloading that may have\npostponed the hit from tariffs to the GDP growth and\ntherefore commodity demand.\nWhat is already very clear, though, is the impact of the\ntariffs on metals, on metals markets. In particular, we\nhave a 50% tariff on steel, a 50% tariff on aluminum\nimports, and we expect a 25% tariff on copper markets. So\nfar, we are seeing pretty significant price increases for US\nsteel and US aluminum, so these tariffs are leading to\nsignificantly higher prices. And we do think that the\npossibility of a 25% tariff, perhaps a 50% tariff, on US\ncopper imports is providing opportunities for investors\nbecause what traders are now trying to do is they're trying\nto get the metals shipped into the US before the potential\ndeadline, and that's leading to very significant tightness in\nthe rest of the world. Inventory levels in places like China\nand the world excluding the US have fallen to only 10 days'\nworth of consumption, so that's putting a lot of upward\npressure on prices outside of the US. And so we do think\n\n15\nthat the threat of tariffs on copper is causing price upside\nboth in the US mechanically because people will have to\npay for the tariff but also outside of the US.\nAllison Nathan: Right. But that's a pretty temporary\nphenomenon. You'd expect that eventually to play out.\nDaan Struyven: That's right. That's right.\nAllison Nathan: And if we think about the other major\ndevelopment that I mentioned, the fiscal deficits, both in\nthe US and then in Europe as we see this increase in\ndefense spending, maybe a welcome increase, what are the\nimplications of that for commodities?\nDaan Struyven: Yeah, I may sound like a broken record\nbut again metals feel like the winners of these meta trends\nas opposed to energy. On fiscal specifically, if markets\nwere to become more concerned again about US fiscal\nsustainability, perhaps if the being beautiful bill gets\napproved, we think gold would be the winner. What we\nhave seen over the last two months is a very positive\ncorrelation between a long-dated US yield -- the 30-year\ntreasury yield on the one hand -- and the gold price. So,\n\n16\nperiods when the market gets worried about US\nsustainability or periods where rates go up and the gold\nprice rises.\nDefense specifically, the industrial metals should benefit.\nThe data are a little hard to get, but a report from the\ndefense department showed that about 5% of US copper\ndemand is driven by the defense industry, so sizable share,\nand 13% of nickel demand. So we do think that industrial\nmetals, especially nickel, are well positioned to benefit from\na structurally higher level of defense spending.\nAllison Nathan: How much of that, though, is already\npriced in? We've been talking about this for a while, so\nyou'd imagine that traders would be positioned for this to\nsome extent already.\nDaan Struyven: Yes, although commodities tend to be\nmore spot assets and less forward looking than equities.\nAnd also, second, these are pretty long-lasting trends. I\nthink the main takeaway from the NATO summit in The\nHague last week was that, yes, Europe plans to go to 3.5,\nperhaps even 5% of defense spending as a share of GDP\nbut it will take a while.\n\n17\nAllison Nathan: So then putting this all together, how\nwould you think about the relative upside of various\ncommodities heading into the second half of the year?\nDaan Struyven: We see the most upside for gold and for\nUS copper and see the most downside for oil. We see the\nmost upside for gold because of structurally higher central\nbank demand for gold, and it's also a great hedge against\nseveral of the key risks including tariff escalation or\nconcerns about US fiscal sustainability. We also see\nsignificant upside to US copper prices because the copper\nmarket is currently pricing at only a 15% tariff on US\ncopper imports and our base case is 25% with risk skewed\ntowards a 50% tariff on copper. Finally, we see the most\ndownside to oil prices. Base case, another $10 per barrel\nlower over the next 12 months because of very strong\nsupply growth, and it could go even lower if OPEC were to\nraise production more than our base case.\nAllison Nathan: I have to say it again, it is so striking to\nme that given everything that has evolved with the Middle\nEast that oil has the least upside here, but you make a\nvery convincing case. Thanks so much for joining us,\n\n18\nDaan.\nDaan Struyven: Thanks a lot, Allison.\nAllison Nathan: This episode of Goldman Sachs\nExchanges was recorded on Monday, June 30th. I'm\nAllison Nathan.

Together\nwe're co-hosting a series of episodes exploring the rise of AI\nand everything it could mean for companies, investors, and\neconomies. George, good to see you again.\nGeorge Lee: Great to be here, Allison.\nAllison Nathan: George, I'm very excited for this\nconversation because today we're going to discuss one of\nthe biggest questions about the rise of AI: Where will the\npower come from? We know that it consumes enormous\n\n2\namounts of power; that's come up in a lot of our\nconversations. And in the first episode of this series, I\nthink you said it may be one of the biggest constraints to\nthe growth and development of AI. So let's dig deeper into\nthat. Tell us why that is.\nGeorge Lee: There's a temptation to think about AI\nas this sort of ephemeral phenomenon, the great chatbot in\nthe sky. The reality is this is one of the most physical\ntechnology infrastructures ever built. Vast data centers\nfilled with racks of servers and GPUs and other gear. All of\nthat gear requires enormous amount of power and at a\nscale and density that probably has never been seen in the\nhistory of computation before.\nThat coming at the same time of a bunch of other emergent\npower needs in the world has really made power kind of\nperhaps the most binding constraint or bottleneck on the\ndelivery of the promises of AI. And probably more\ninteresting, it brings together two very orthogonal\npopulations in our commercial ecosystem -- hyperscalers\nand the fastest-moving, most innovative technology\ncompanies in the world and highly regulated utilities. And\nour guest, Rebecca Kruger, stands at the very nexus of\n\n3\nthose two populations. So, it'll be fascinating to have this\ndiscussion with her.\nAllison Nathan: So, let's bring Rebecca into the\nconversation. Rebecca is a partner in our Natural\nResources Group within our Investment Banking division,\nwhich just published a report entitled \"Powering the AI\nEra.\" Rebecca, welcome.\nRebecca Kruger: Thank you. Thrilled to be here.\nAllison Nathan: So Rebecca, in your job, you are talking\nto leaders in this space, corporate leaders in this space, all\nthe time. How is AI dominating those conversations at this\npoint?\nRebecca Kruger: It's been top of the list. To say that\nAI and the associated power demand has been a focus for\nour clients is a true understatement. And by the way, the\nCEOs and the boards of our biggest power companies, they\nwill tell you both privately and publicly the power demand\nthat they're seeing is unprecedented, and there's no\nplaybook for this.\n\n4\nBut to understand why that is -- because it seems pretty\nsimple, right? AI data centers are getting built, let's just\nbuild some power plants. It's actually not that simple.\nThere's a lot that's going into it. So just to set the table for\na sec on how did we get here, right? So in the last 20 years\nin the US, power demand has been flat. And that's despite\na growing economy, despite growing population, we all have\nmore devices that we're plugging in. But offsetting all of\nthat has been offshoring, so we've been shutting down a lot\nof manufacturing plants in the US. That's obviously\nchanging as we try and reshore a lot of manufacturing\ncapacity. And then number two, appliances just got a lot\nmore efficient.\nAnd so during those 20 years of when electricity demand\nwas totally flat, a lot of things calcified on that assumption.\nIt was taken for granted that would always be the case.\nAnd so energy policy, for example, started to prioritize low-\nemission sources of generation. That's a really good thing.\nDecarbonizing our economy is a great thing to do.\nHowever, intermittent emission-free generation sources like\nwind and solar are not available all the time. And we're not\nquite there yet on technology of long-duration storage. And\n\n5\nso as a result of energy policy, which has really been\nprioritizing decarbonization, our grid has been getting less\nreliable. Fewer power plants that can operate 24/7, which\nis what data centers obviously need, and more power\nsources that are what we call intermittent.\nEven before the AI demand story started taking off,\nparticipants in the industry were already getting nervous\nabout reliability of the grid. And EV charging was viewed\nas the straw that was going to break the camel's back\nbecause of all the electricity demand that was going to\nbring, and the grid just wasn't ready. The AI demand story\nis just a step-change in the amount of demand. And so we\ncan get into it in more detail, but the process of getting\nmore megawatts from more power plants online and\nserving this load is a really complicated issue.\nAllison Nathan: And the infrastructure, by the way, is\nquite old at this point as well.\nRebecca Kruger: Yeah, that's right. Not only are our\npower plants in the US quite old, the grid, the actual wires\nthat get electrons from where they're produced to where\nthey're consumed, is on average 40-plus years old and not\n\n6\ngetting any younger. And the permitting to build new\ntransmission lines is quite time-consuming.\nAllison Nathan: So how are companies going to meet\nthis increased demand? What is the plan?\nRebecca Kruger: So like everything in energy land,\nthere is no one-size-fits-all solution. And so we've seen\nsome really interesting partnerships pop up between tech\ncompanies and power companies to get more megawatts or\nmore power plants online. So let me give you some\nexamples of that.\nThere are nuclear plants, which amazingly enough, were\ntotally uneconomic and out of the money just a few years\nago. They were highly subsidized a couple years ago.\nNuclear plants are exactly what data centers need. It's\nclean, firm, power, 24/7 power. And so you're seeing the\nhyperscalers partner with some of the owners of these\nnuclear plants to bring some of them back online. Three\nMile Island. It was a recent headline there.\nAnother option at nuclear sites is there's usually excess\nland there, and so there's something called uprates. So\n\n7\nbuilding more megawatts at an existing nuclear site. So\nthose are some of the low-hanging fruit in the sector. You\ncan probably count on one or two hands the number of\nopportunities that I just described that are out there.\nThere's a lot happening on new construction, but there's a\ntiming mismatch. It takes one to two years to get one of\nthese data centers online. It can take -- and I hate to say it\n-- five, ten years plus to get some of this power generation\nonline. The current administration's doing a lot to try and\nspeed that up -- the permitting and the siting and all of\nthat. And they're having some success in that, which is\ngreat. But it's not just that. It's the supply chain to build\nout some of these assets is quite backed up. A gas\ncombustion turbine, to build a new gas-fired power plant,\nthey're sold out until 2030. And so that is what's driving\nthe bottleneck when we say that power is the biggest\nconstraint on data center build-out.\nGeorge Lee: Fascinating. Let's double-click on that\nsort of cadence mismatch between the fast-moving\nhyperscalers, people who want to produce this AI\ncomputation, and the way that utilities are run, governed,\nand are subject to the gravity of those very real supply\n\n8\nchain constraints. How do you see them navigating that\nmismatch culturally and temporally?\nRebecca Kruger: It's been so interesting. So George,\nyou hit this in the intro, which is these two industries\nwhich historically have not had to really interact or work\ntogether in a major way, they have two completely different\napproaches to how they attack their problems. One is\nmove fast and break things. The other is do no harm, and I\noperate under a 30-year planning cycle and my only job is\nto deliver safe and affordable power.\nBut it's been really fascinating watching these two\nindustries come together to solve each other's problems.\nAnd so we can talk more about some of the partnerships\nthat we're seeing there, but the other really exciting thing\nthat's happening is, during those 20 years of flat power\ndemand, there wasn't a lot of price signals or incentives for\nanyone really to invest in R&D to develop new technologies\nor to rethink how we produce and consume energy in this\ncountry. That's changing really rapidly, and some of the\nbiggest proponents and funders of it are the hyperscalers.\nAnd so one of the examples that I think is most exciting is\n\n9\nthis concept called peak shaving or making load more\nflexible. And the grid in the US is built for peak demand.\nSo that one hour in August in Texas when everyone's got\ntheir AC on, that peak demand is what the grid is built for\nbecause the AC's need to go on, the lights need to go on\nwhen people flip the switch. But for so much of the year\nthere's a lot of unused capacity, and so on the one hand,\nthere's headlines out there saying, like, all the lights are\ngoing to go out because AI is going to gobble up all the\npower. It's much more nuanced because there are all these\nunused megawatts that don't get used for most of the year.\nAnd so some of these new technologies or innovations are\ngoing to help data centers become flexible demand centers.\nGeorge Lee: Yeah, and we've done a lot of work\ntogether on this topic, and it implies not only, you know,\nchanges in demand management on your side of the\nequation but, for the hyperscalers and producers of AI\ncomputation, re-instrumenting their algorithms to be able\nto deal with that intermittency. And we think there's a lot\nwe -- I think mutually believe there's a lot of headroom\nthere for sure.\nThe other thing that's very differentiated between the two\n\n10\npopulations of companies is the quantum of capital\navailable and the way they think about it. These are\nexpensive projects. Talk about how the two populations\nare coming together to find joint solutions to capital\nnumbers that would have seemed unimaginable years ago\nto your clients.\nRebecca Kruger: Well, and these capital projects, a\nfew years ago these numbers would have been\nunimaginable. But we're talking overall projects, the data\ncenter plus the power, into the tens of billions of dollars.\nAnd what's so fascinating about it is power is just a small\nfraction of the overall cost of the data center build-out.\nWe're talking maybe 10% of the total cost. But as people\nwho follow the power sector know, the average size of a\npower company is a small fraction of the size of\nhyperscalers.\nAnd so there's definitely a difference in terms of size and\namount of resources, but in some ways it's a great fit. It's\nlike these two puzzle pieces coming together where they\nboth want the infrastructure built. The power companies\nultimately want to own it and operate it. It's what they're\ngreat at. It's what they're here to do. They have stretch\n\n11\nbalance sheets, right? These projects and the amount of\npower they're being asked to build, in some cases doubling\nwhat they currently have operating. I mean, that's mind\nblowing right? When you think about the fact that it took\neach of these power companies or utilities 50, 100 years to\nbuild up what they have today, they're being asked to\ndouble that in the next ten years, so it's stunning when you\nthink about it.\nOn the other hand, the hyperscalers, they have vast\nfinancial resources. And so there's a lot of interesting\nnegotiations and partnerships being discussed and\nnegotiated in real time on how can the hyperscalers use\ntheir balance sheets and their financial resources to help\nget some of these assets built.\nGeorge Lee: Do we have a generation problem or a\ntransmission problem or both?\nRebecca Kruger: Yes.\nGeorge Lee: Right. I thought that might be the\nanswer.\n\n12\nRebecca Kruger: Yeah, I mean, power is a very local\nor regional industry. It's largely consumed close to where\nit's produced because there's a lot of what we call line loss\nas you transmit electrons from where it's generated to\nwhere it's ultimately used. And so number one, the\nconcept of siting the user of electricity close to the power\nplant, it's just more efficient. And in fact, you're seeing\nwhat we call more \"behind the meter\" generation solutions.\nSo data centers literally siting behind the fence, their data\ncenters right next door to the power plant, right? So we're\nseeing some of that.\nThat said, we also have some generation assets in pockets\nof the country that are underutilized today. And so to the\nextent we can build some new lines to get those electrons\nfrom where they're currently underutilized to some load\ncenter, that can also help in a really big way because, again\nI said it earlier, there's no one-size-fits-all solution here.\nIt's going to be both. More megawatts and more\ntransmission.\nGeorge Lee: So you talked \"behind the meter,\"\n\"inside the fence\" scenarios. You also illustrated the\nchallenge of asking companies that have been around for\n\n13\n100 years to double their capacity in a matter of years. To\nwhat extent do the big tech companies and hyperscalers\ntake matters into their own hands and vertically integrate\nand build capacity themselves, co-located with big\nfacilities, particularly in an era where we may see hopefully\nsee things like small modular nuclear or nuclear fusion?\nDo you think that'll ensue?\nRebecca Kruger: So it's possible. It's been\ninteresting watching the journey on the tech side as they\nstarted getting very smart -- and this is not recent, this has\nbeen a journey they've been on for many years. But they've\nreached a point where they are so sophisticated on energy,\nand they are very effective advocates in DC on energy policy\nbecause, you know, as mentioned, it's their biggest\nbottleneck. And so they care about the policy that's\ncoming out in DC.\nTo date, we have not seen the hyperscalers leaning in to\nown outright the generation assets. I think they would tell\nyou it's just not their core business. The power companies,\nthat is their core business, and so why mix that up? That\nsaid, this is all moving so quickly. And so, if they form the\npoint of view that would be a more efficient, faster path to\n\n14\ngetting the power, maybe, right? I think a lot of things are\non the table.\nI think longer term, you mentioned SMRs, so small\nmodular reactors, which is an emerging technology of\nnuclear plants. There is a vision. And so SMRs are around\n350 megawatts, which is a good size, you know, an\nappropriate size for medium-, small-sized data centers, but\nthey certainly can be stacked for larger data centers.\nThere's a vision in the technology sector that maybe, just\nmaybe, as the SMR technology advances, it can be part of\nthe modular construction design for a data center.\nSo a data center has the shell, the SMR, the chips, and\nyou're good to go, right? So that's some vision for the\nfuture. Whether we get there or whether the power\ncompanies continue to own the assets, time will tell.\nAllison Nathan: Is there any concern that we are going\nto be so focused on build that we're eventually going to over\nbuild in a sense? I mean, when we think about there's\nsome concern that data centers might get over built.\nRebecca Kruger: So it's a great question, and what\n\n15\nI'll -- you know the history of the power sector. There have\nbeen many booms and busts. And there's been a lot of\ncapital and money loss on over build cycles. Companies\nhave gone bankrupt.\nAnd so what was so interesting about the last call it 18\nmonths, I actually think the power sector was the last\ngroup of folks to believe in this demand story because I\nthink they had PTSD from the last boom and bust cycles.\nAnd so that's shaping the power companies' approach to\nthis build-out in some really important ways.\nData centers and the life cycle of a chip is four years, would\nyou say, George?\nGeorge Lee: It's a matter of debate, and it's\nsomewhere between three to six years, depending.\nRebecca Kruger: Yeah, okay. So --\nGeorge Lee: Probably on the shorter end in my view.\nRebecca Kruger: Right. And so therein lies the\nchallenge, right? Which is the power plants and\n\n16\ntransmission lines, these are 30-year assets. And so the\nlast thing a power company wants to do is build this\ncapacity solely for this customer and then be left holding\nthe bag when, four years from now, the data center is\nobsolete, right? Or not in use anymore.\nAnd so it's leading to contracts that we're seen being struck\nbetween the power companies and the hyperscalers on\ncertainly minimum tenures and return on enough capital\nduring the contract tenure. And so the power companies\nfeel good that their investments are being protected, and\nthe hyperscalers are getting what they need in terms of the\npower.\nAnd as you turn up the dial on the power price, what does\nthat do to the overall hyperscalers' return on the data\ncenter complex? It's not much of a needle mover because\nit's such a small input on the overall cost. And so I\nmentioned before that it's like these two puzzle pieces that\nfit really well together. Power companies are very price\nsensitive. I think a hyperscaler would never tell you they're\nprice insensitive, but they have a little bit more flexibility in\nterms of what they're able to pay and the terms that they're\nable to agree to.\n\n17\nAllison Nathan: So interesting. So we've talked about\nthe supply chain constraints to building out this\ninfrastructure. Are there other constraints that we should\nbe focused on? Regulatory constraints or something else\nthat we're missing here and that's going to make this even\nmore challenging?\nRebecca Kruger: So there's a couple. All solvable\nultimately but craft labor is one. And so there's a lot of\ntalk of new nuclear getting built. The last nuclear plant\nthat got built in the US at its peak had north of 10,000\nworkers on site. There's talk of, you know, we are entering\nthe next nuclear renaissance. You can only imagine how\nmany workers just to build out those nuclear plants are\ngoing to be required.\nBut even putting nuclear to the side, building out\ntransmission lines, building out gas-fire generation, we\nexpect a real effort, an advocacy effort from DC, on pointing\npeople, workers, back towards these trades because it's\ncritically important. We are short on labor.\nAnd then policy, to your point. And we've seen President\n\n18\nTrump, his first day in office declared a national energy\nemergency. And so there has been a flurry of executive\norders and pushes on policy to streamline permitting, to try\nand clear the way for new nuclear to get built, and there's\nmany others that have been happening as this\nadministration tries to get more firm baseload power built\nonto the grid.\nAllison Nathan: So what does this all add up to in terms\nof deal flow in the sector?\nRebecca Kruger: Yeah, so it's been very, very active,\nboth in terms of M&A and strategic financing. And so on\nthe M&A side, because megawatts and the overall power\ninfrastructure complex is becoming such a more valuable\nand scarce asset, you're seeing a lot of consolidation. This\nyear alone we've seen $30 billion acquisition of a large gas-\nfire power portfolio. We've seen a 12 billion acquisition of,\nyou know, something similar. So a lot of consolidation\nhappening there.\nAnd then in terms of strategic financing, there's a lot of\npockets of private capital that are trying to invest to help\nfund the build-out of all of this infrastructure. So we're\n\n19\nsitting right in the middle of all of that, trying to match the\ncapital with where it's needed so that this power can get\nbuilt as efficiently as possible.\nAllison Nathan: Interesting. I mean, as I'm listening to\nall of this, I think there's just a bigger question here, which\nis AI going to really drive a transformational shift in the US\npower grid and landscape? Even the global power grid and\nlandscape? Do you see a reshaping of the power landscape\noff the back of all this?\nRebecca Kruger: I think a couple comments there.\nNumber one, the US power sector was already under-\ninvesting, and there were some reliability concerns that\nwere coming. And so this huge demand story is putting\neverything front and center all at once, and it's forcing\npolicymakers and every other stakeholder in this big puzzle\nto focus on these problems and solve them. So that's a\ngood thing. That's a really good thing.\nAnd you've got stakeholders across the board on both sides\nof the table who have deep pockets and deep financial\nresources throwing their resources at this problem, so\nthat's a good thing for the country because, at the end of\n\n20\nthe day, reliable, affordable power is a good thing for us as\na country.\nI do expect more innovation. Carbon capture, for example,\nis getting a lot more focus and investment than it was\npreviously, and so that's basically take your gas-fired\npower plants, put carbon capture and sequestration\nequipment on it, and it lowers the overall emissions of that\npower plant. That's a great thing, right? And it's a win-win\nbecause the hyperscalers ultimately who will be off takers\nthere, they do care about the emission content of their\npower.\nMaybe the last thing I'd say on this is I think\nfundamentally how we can produce and consumer energy\nin this country is going to be changing. Over the last 20\nyears when we had flat demand growth, there wasn't the\nprice signals that really triggered and motivated innovation.\nWe are seeing that in spades today, and it's a really\nexciting time as a result.\nAllison Nathan: So interesting. Thanks again for joining\nus, Rebecca.\n\n21\nRebecca Kruger: Thanks for having me. This was\nterrific.\nGeorge Lee: Great discussion, as anticipated. I want\nto feature the thing that Rebecca ended with, which I think\nthere is an optimistic frame. There are real challenges\nhere. You have regulated utilities who own fealty and\nobligation to rate payers. There's a lot of concern about\ncontinuity and price of electrons for them. This is clearly a\ngenerational challenge to meet this need. And yet you are\ninterposing a set of entities that are the most innovative,\ntech-forward entities in the world. They now can turn their\nattention to bringing more efficiency, more change, more\nnew ideas to this older ecosystem.\nAnd I think it promises the potential, as your question\nsignaled, for a very high rate of change in this kind of slow-\nmoving ecosystem in the next five to ten years. Frankly,\nwe'll need it.\nAllison Nathan: Absolutely. Couldn't agree more. I\nmean, bringing innovation to this sector, you know, has got\nto be a win-win.\n\n22\nGeorge Lee: But to their credit, and as Rebecca\nmentioned, really responding, partnering well with these\ncompanies. This is not a population of companies who are\nburying their head in the sand. Like, they recognize the\nopportunity, the need, and I think they're really rising to\nmeet the challenge. Pretty inspiring actually.\nAllison Nathan: Absolutely. Well, thanks again, George.\nI am looking forward to our next conversation.\nGeorge Lee: As am I.

We favor a mix of income sources. We like short-term government bonds: the\nU.S. budget bill passed last month highlighted a lack of fiscal discipline,\nwhile sticky inflation limits rate cuts, keeping us tactically cautious on\nlong-term bonds. In credit, resilient growth has kept corporate balance sheets\nsolid even with tariffs.\n\n\n\nIncome is back\nFixed income assets with yields of 4% of larger, 2000-2025\n\nAfter the global financial crisis (GFC), bond yields slid as central banks\nslashed policy rates to near zero or below and bought bonds. That left investors\nstarved of income unless they took risk in long-term bonds. In a stark\nswitch-up, some 80% of global fixed income assets now offer yields above 4% as\ninterest rates have settled above pre-pandemic levels. See the chart. That’s\nmade assets like credit, mortgage- backed securities and emerging market debt\nmore attractive. We have seen notable bond market developments this year. Credit\nspreads have been relatively steady even with sharp equity volatility. And\ninvestors are demanding more compensation for the risk of holding long-term\nbonds, leading to a steepening of global yield curves. The curve between five\nand 30-year U.S. Treasury yields has more than doubled this year to its steepest\nlevels since 2021, according to LSEG data.\n\nWe see abundant opportunities to earn income. We prefer short- and medium-term\ngovernment bonds given yields near 4%. Markets are pricing in multiple Federal\nReserve rate cuts over the next year. Yet we see sticky inflation limiting rate\ncuts – even as renewed rate hikes are unlikely. Our preference is partly driven\nby our caution on long-term bonds due to the lack of U.S. fiscal discipline and\nsticky inflation – though we could see occasional sharp rallies. The U.S. is\nissuing nearly $500 billion of debt weekly to fund its persistent budget\ndeficits, per Haver Analytics. And the Congressional Budget Office expects the\nOne Big Beautiful Bill to only add to deficits in the near term. Trade tensions\ncould cool foreign demand at a time when sustaining U.S. debt relies on their\nongoing buying – as we noted in our 2025 Midyear Outlook. We’re watching the\nmarket’s ability to absorb heavy Treasury issuance. Fiscal sustainability is not\njust a U.S. story: In Japan, 30-year yields hit a record high last week as\npolicymakers floated tax cuts before Sunday’s upper house election.\n\nWhere we find income\n\nHigher U.S. policy rates mean interest rate differentials between the U.S. and\nother countries stay wide, revealing an array of global fixed income\nopportunities. That’s because hedging foreign bonds back into U.S. dollars\nboosts the income they offer. Some euro area bonds, like Spain, offer yields\nabove 5% with such hedging – higher than U.S. equivalents. Credit has become a\nclear choice for quality. Spreads are historically tight, yet credit income\nremains attractive as balance sheets have held up alongside growth, even with\ntariff uncertainty. Default rates for U.S. high yield credit remain about half\nthe 25-year average, according to J.P. Morgan data. We prefer European fixed\nincome over the U.S. given a more stable fiscal outlook, especially European\nbank debt given strong financial earnings and insulation from tariff impacts.\n\nWe get selective across and within regions. We went overweight U.S. agency\nmortgage-backed securities (MBS): spreads are wider than historical averages and\nwe could see some investors switch from long-term Treasuries. We upped local\ncurrency emerging market (EM) debt to neutral this month: it has weathered U.S.\ntrade policy shifts, and debt levels have improved.\n\nOur bottom line\n\nWe like a mix of income opportunities but stay selective due to fiscal\nsustainability risks. We favor short- and medium-term government bonds, U.S.\nagency MBS, currency hedged international bonds and local currency EM debt.\n\nMarket backdrop\n\nThe S&P 500 hit new record highs last week, helped by signs of U.S. economic\nresilience in strong U.S. retail sales data. U.S. corporate earnings season\nkicked off with some big tech companies, putting renewed focus on artificial\nintelligence and capital spending. The index quickly recovered from reports that\nU.S. President Donald Trump discussed removing Fed Chair Jerome Powell, which\nTrump denied. Thirty-year Treasury yields ended the week steady at 4.99%, near\nMay’s two-year high.\n\nThis week, we’re watching the European Central Bank’s (ECB) policy decision. We\nexpect it to hold rates steady until September. The central bank now sees policy\nrates within a neutral range that neither stimulates nor restricts economic\nactivity, inflation remains around its 2% target, and euro area growth shows\nlittle change. We watch for signals on whether the ECB will stay cautious or\nbegin laying the groundwork for easing later this year.\n\nRead our past weekly market commentaries .\n\n \n\nBig calls\n\nOur highest conviction views on tactical (6-12 month) and strategic (long-term)\nhorizons, July 2025\n\nTactical granular views\n\nSix- to 12-month tactical views on selected assets vs. broad global asset\nclasses by level of conviction, July 2025\n\nLegend Granular\n\nThe table below reflects our views on a tactical horizon and, importantly,\nleaves aside the opportunity for alpha, or the potential to generate\nabove-benchmark returns – especially at times of heightened volatility.\n\nEuro-denominated tactical granular views\n\nSix to 12-month tactical views on selected assets vs. broad global asset classes\nby level of conviction, July 2025\n\nLegend Granular"}

Yet we think U.S. equities will regain global\nleadership as the AI theme keeps providing near-term earnings support and could\ndrive productivity in the long term.\n\nUsing FX to enhance income\n\nFX hedging is now a source of income, especially when hedging euro area bonds\nback into U.S. dollars. For example, 10-year government bonds in France or Spain\noffer more income when currency hedged than U.S. investment grade credit, with\nyields above 5%.\n\nSeeking alpha sources\n\nWe identify sources of risk taking to be more deliberate in earning alpha. These\ninclude the potential impact of regulatory changes on corporate earnings,\nspotting crowded positions where markets could snap back and opportunities to\nprovide liquidity during periods of stress.\n\nStrategic\n\n \n\nInfrastructure equity and private credit\n\nWe see opportunities in infrastructure equity due to attractive relative\nvaluations and mega forces. We think private credit will earn lending share as\nbanks retreat – and at attractive returns.\n\nFixed income granularity\n\nWe prefer short-term inflation-linked bonds over nominal developed market (DM)\ngovernment bonds, as U.S. tariffs could push up inflation. Within DM government\nbonds, we favor UK gilts over other regions.\n\nEquity granularity\n\nWe favor emerging over developed markets yet get selective in both.

In DM, we like Japan as the return of inflation and corporate\nreforms brighten the outlook.\n\nEquities\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nUnited States\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are overweight. Policy-driven volatility and supply-side constraints are\npressuring growth, but we see AI supporting corporate earnings. U.S. valuations\nare backed by stronger earnings and profitability relative to other developed\nmarkets.\n\nEurope\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Greater unity and a pro-growth agenda across Europe could boost\nactivity, yet we are watching how the bloc tackles its structural challenges\nbefore turning more optimistic. We note selective opportunities in financials\nand industries tied to defense and infrastructure spending.\n\nUK\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Political stability could improve investor sentiment. Yet an\nincrease in the corporate tax burden could hurt profit margins near term.\n\nJapan\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are overweight given the return of inflation and shareholder-friendly\ncorporate reforms. We prefer unhedged exposures as the yen has tended to\nstrengthen during bouts of market stress.\n\nEmerging markets (EM)\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Valuations and domestic policy are supportive. Yet geopolitical\ntensions and concerns about global growth keep us sidelined for now.\n\nChina\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Trade policy uncertainty keeps us cautious, and policy stimulus\nis still limited. We still see structural challenges to China’s growth,\nincluding an aging population.\n\nFixed income\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nShort U.S. Treasuries\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are overweight. We view short-term Treasuries as akin to cash in our tactical\nviews. We would still lean against the market pricing of multiple Fed rate cuts\nover the next year.\n\nLong U.S. Treasuries\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are underweight. Persistent budget deficits and inflation pressures could\ndrive term premium up over the long term, but we see scope for lower yields near\nterm. We prefer intermediate maturities.\n\nGlobal inflation-linked bonds\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are neutral. We see higher medium-term inflation, but cooling inflation and\ngrowth may matter more near term.\n\nEuro area government bonds\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Yields are attractive, and term premium has risen closer to our\nexpectations relative to U.S. Treasuries. We prefer peripheral bonds such as in\nItaly and Spain.\n\nUK gilts\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Gilt yields are off their highs, but the risk of higher U.S.\nyields having a knock-on impact and reducing the UK’s fiscal space has risen. We\nare monitoring the UK fiscal situation.\n\nJapanese government bonds\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are underweight. We see room for yields to rise further on Bank of Japan rate\nhikes and a higher global term premium\n\nChina government bonds\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Bonds are supported by looser policy. Yet we find yields more\nattractive in short-term DM paper.\n\nU.S. agency MBS\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are overweight. We find income in agency MBS compelling and prefer them to\nU.S. Treasuries for high-quality fixed income exposure.\n\nShort-term IG credit\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are overweight. Short-term bonds better compensate for interest rate risk.\n\nLong-term IG credit\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are underweight. Spreads are tight, so we prefer taking risk in equities. We\nfavor Europe over the U.S.\n\nGlobal high yield\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Spreads are tight, but corporate fundamentals are solid and it\nprovides attractive income.\n\nAsia credit\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are neutral. We don’t find valuations compelling enough to turn more\npositive.\n\nEmerging hard currency\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are underweight. Spreads to U.S. Treasuries are near historical averages.\nTrade uncertainty has eased, but we find local currency EM debt more attractive.\n\nEmerging local currency\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Debt levels for many EMs have improved, and currencies have held\nup against trade uncertainty. We prefer countries with higher real interest\nrates.\n\nEquities\n\n \n\n \n\n Europe ex UK\n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Greater unity and a pro-growth agenda across Europe could boost\nactivity, yet we are watching how the bloc tackles its structural challenges\nbefore turning more optimistic. We note opportunities in financials and\nindustries tied to defense and infrastructure spending.\n\nGermany\n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Valuations and earnings growth are supportive relative to peers,\nespecially as ECB rate cuts ease financing conditions. Prolonged uncertainty\nabout potential tariffs and fading euphoria over China’s stimulus could dent\nsentiment.\n\nFrance\n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Ongoing political uncertainty could weigh on business conditions\nfor French companies. Yet only a small share of the revenues and operations of\nmajor French firms is tied to domestic activity.\n\nItaly\n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Valuations are supportive relative to peers. Yet past growth and\nearnings outperformance largely stemmed from significant fiscal stimulus in\n2022-2023, which is unlikely to be sustained in the coming years.\n\nSpain\n\n\n\nWe are overweight. Valuations and earnings growth are supportive compared to\nother euro area stocks. Financials, utilities and infrastructure stocks stand to\ngain from a strong economic backdrop and advancements in AI.\n\nNetherlands\n\n\n\nWe are neutral. The Dutch stock market’s tilt to technology and semiconductors —\nkey beneficiaries of rising AI demand—is offset by less favorable valuations and\na weaker earnings outlook compared to European peers.\n\nSwitzerland\n\n\n\nWe are neutral, consistent with our broader European view. Earnings have\nimproved, but valuations remain elevated compared to other European markets. The\nindex’s defensive tilt may offer less support if global risk appetite stays\nstrong.\n\nUK\n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Political stability could improve investor sentiment. Yet an\nincrease in the corporate tax burden could hurt profit margins near term.\n\nFixed income\n\n \n\n \n\nEuro area government bonds\n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Yields are attractive, and term premium has risen closer to our\nexpectations relative to U.S. Treasuries. We prefer peripheral bonds such as in\nItaly and Spain.\n\nGerman bunds\n\n\n\nWe are underweight. Market pricing aligns with our policy rate expectations, but\ngrowth support fiscal stimulus is likely to push up neutral rates. More balanced\ninflation risks and bond issuance could push term premium up.\n\nFrench OATs\n\n\n\nWe are underweight. France continues to face challenges from elevated political\nuncertainty, persistent budget deficits and a slower pace of structural reforms.\n\nItalian BTPs\n\n\n\nWe are neutral. The spread over German bunds looks tight given its large budget\ndeficits and growing public debt. Domestic factors remain supportive, with\ngrowth holding up relative to the rest of the euro area and Italian households\nshowing solid demand to hold BTPs at higher yields. Given the domestic political\npushback, we do not think Italy will boost defense spending to such an extent\nthat fiscal stability concerns resurface.\n\nUK gilts\n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Gilt yields are off their highs, but the risk of higher U.S.\nyields having a knock-on impact and reducing the UK’s fiscal space has risen. We\nare monitoring the UK fiscal situation.\n\nSwiss government bonds\n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Markets are expecting policy rates to return to negative\nterritory, which we deem as unlikely.\n\nEuropean inflation-linked bonds\n\n\n\nWe are neutral. We see higher medium-term inflation, but inflation expectations\nare firmly anchored. Cooling inflation and uncertain growth may matter more near\nterm.\n\nEuropean investment grade credit\n\n\n\nWe are neutral on European investment grade credit, favoring short- to\nmedium-term paper for quality income. We prefer European investment grade over\nthe U.S., as quality-adjusted spreads are relatively wider.\n\nEuropean high yield\n\n\n\nWe are overweight. The income potential is attractive, and we prefer European\nhigh yield for its more appealing valuations, higher quality and less\nsensitivity to interest rate swings compared with the U.S. Spreads adequately\ncompensate for the risk of a potential rise in defaults, in our view."}

The small-cap Russell 2000 was also positive, while the Dow Jones\nIndustrial Average and S&P Midcap 400 Index ended in negative territory.\n\nEarnings season began in earnest on Tuesday with several big banks reporting\nearnings. JP Morgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, and Citigroup both reported\nbetter-than-expected results for the second quarter. Then on Thursday,\nwell-known consumer-facing names such as PepsiCo, United Airlines, and Netflix\nreleased reports that beat forecasts.\n\nIn other company-specific news, chipmaker NVIDIA announced that it had received\npermission from the Trump administration to sell its H2O artificial intelligence\nchips to China. NVIDIA, which hit the USD 4 trillion market capitalization level\nfor the first time in early July, rallied on the announcement.\n\nINFLATION ACCELERATES, WHILE RETAIL SALES REBOUND\n\nStock investors also seemed to appreciate economic reports that pointed to\nconsumer strength and inflation levels that, while not improving, didn’t seem\ntoo worrisome. Notably, the consumer price index (CPI) showed its biggest\nmonthly increase in five months but generally matched consensus estimates.\n\nCPI increased 0.3% month over month in June, up from 0.1% in May, with some\neconomists pointing to higher tariffs as a driver of the price increases. On a\nyear-over-year basis, prices rose 2.7%, up from May’s 2.4%. Core CPI, which\nexcludes volatile food and energy costs, increased 2.9% year over year, ticking\nup from 2.8% in May. Prices of household goods, recreational goods, and footwear\nhave all accelerated since April. However, these increases were offset somewhat\nby lower car prices.\n\nInvestors were also focused on the Census Department’s retail sales report that\nshowed sales up a better-than-expected 0.6% in June after falling 0.9% in May.\nReports that President Donald Trump was planning to fire Federal Reserve Chair\nJerome Powell put downward pressure on stocks on Wednesday, but the move was\nquickly reversed when Trump said he wasn’t going to remove Powell. Trump has\nbeen a fierce critic of the Fed chief as the central bank has paused further\nrate cuts so far this year.\n\nCORPORATE BONDS OUTPERFORM TREASURIES\n\nIntermediate- and long-term U.S. Treasury yields finished the week little\nchanged, while short-term yields marginally decreased amid speculation about\nPowell’s future at the Fed. (Bond prices and yields move in opposite\ndirections.) The U.S. investment-grade corporate bond market outperformed\nTreasuries. Investment-grade corporate issuance was in line with expectations\nand was largely oversubscribed.\n\nThis chart is for illustrative purposes only and does not represent the\nperformance of any specific security.

Major stock indexes were mixed. Italy’s FTSE MIB gained 0.58%, while\nGermany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 Index were little changed. The UK’s FTSE 100\nIndex rose 0.57%, helped partly by the depreciation of the UK pound against the\nU.S. dollar. A weaker pound lends support to the index because many of its\ncompanies are multinationals that generate meaningful overseas revenue.\n\nUK INFLATION WORSE THAN EXPECTED; UNEMPLOYMENT HIGHER; WAGE GROWTH SLOWS\n\nThe annual rate of consumer price inflation in the UK unexpectedly rose to 3.6%\nin June from 3.4% in May, the fastest pace since January 2024. Higher prices for\ntransport, especially motor fuels, drove the increase. Services inflation—a key\nmetric for the Bank of England—stayed at 4.7%, indicating persistent underlying\ncost pressures. The consensus expectation had been for services inflation to\nease.\n\nThe UK labor market appeared to cool further in the three months through May.\nThe unemployment rate ticked higher to 4.7% from 4.6% in the three months\nthrough April, the highest level in four years. The number of payrolled\nemployees declined by an estimated 41,000 in June, after a drop of 25,000 in\nMay. Meanwhile, annual pay growth excluding bonuses was slightly higher than\nanalysts had expected, coming in at 5.0%. This latest figure was down from an\nupwardly revised 5.3% the previous month.\n\nEUROZONE INDUSTRY OUTPUT EXPANDS; TRADE SURPLUS WIDENS MORE THAN EXPECTED\n\nIndustrial production in the euro area expanded by 1.7% sequentially in May,\nrebounding from the 2.2% decline recorded in April and beating market\nexpectations for a rise of 0.9%. Increased output of energy, capital goods, and\nnondurable consumer goods drove the expansion. Year over year, output\naccelerated to 3.7% from 0.2% in the prior month.\n\nSeparately, the bloc’s trade surplus widened to EUR 16.2 billion in May from EUR\n12.7 billion a year earlier, as exports rose 0.9% and imports fell 0.6%.\n\nGERMAN INVESTOR SENTIMENT HIGHEST IN THREE YEARS\n\nThe ZEW index of economic sentiment in July rose for a third consecutive month,\ncoming in at 52.7—its highest level since February 2022. Analysts in a FactSet\nsurvey had expected a reading of 50.2. The economic research institute said\nalmost two-thirds of experts polled called for the economy to improve, thanks to\npotential stimulus and expectations for a speedy resolution to the European\nUnion’s trade dispute with the U.S.\n\nJAPAN\n\nJapan’s stock markets registered modest gains over the week, with the Nikkei 225\nIndex rising 0.63% and the broader TOPIX Index up 0.40%. Returns were capped by\npolitical uncertainty ahead of Japan’s Upper House election on July 20, where a\npossible outcome could be that Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s ruling Liberal\nDemocratic Party-Komeito coalition fails to retain majority control.\n\nInvestors’ focus is likely to be on how pro-economy and reformative the new\ncabinet will be, as well as how dovish or hawkish a fiscal policy it adopts. The\nyield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.53% from 1.49% at the\nend of the previous week on investor expectations that the election could result\nin a more fiscally dovish cabinet that seeks to increase government spending.\nThe yen weakened to around the middle of the JPY 148 against the USD range, from\na prior JPY 147.4.\n\nINFLATION COOLS\n\nInflationary pressures showed some signs of easing, as Japan’s core consumer\nprice index (CPI) rose 3.3% year on year in June, less than consensus estimates\nfor a 3.4% increase and down from 3.7% in May. The softening in core inflation\nwas due mainly to falling contributions from energy, reflecting government\nsubsidies.\n\nOn the trade front, with U.S. tariffs weighing on foreign demand, Japan’s\nexports fell 0.5% year on year in June, the second monthly drop and short of\nconsensus estimates of a 0.5% increase. Exports to the U.S. declined sharply due\nto weaker shipments of autos, auto parts, and pharmaceuticals, and sales to\nChina also fell. The U.S. has announced that it will implement a 25% reciprocal\ntariff on Japanese imports, effective August 1; however, bilateral trade talks\nbetween the two countries are ongoing, where a formal deal could be reached.\n\nCHINA\n\nMainland Chinese stock markets recorded a weekly gain. The onshore benchmark CSI\n300 Index rose 1.09% and the Shanghai Composite Index edged up 0.69% in local\ncurrency terms, according to FactSet. In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng\nIndex advanced 2.84%.\n\nChina’s gross domestic product increased 5.2% in the second quarter from a year\nago, compared with the first quarter’s 5.4% growth pace, the country’s\nstatistics bureau reported Tuesday. Analysts said the second quarter’s\nhigher-than-expected growth would likely ease pressure on Beijing to roll out\nfurther stimulus measures anytime soon.\n\nHowever, analysts cautioned that growth would likely slow in the year’s second\nhalf amid worsening deflation pressures, weak retail sales growth, and the\npotential for a flareup in U.S. trade tensions once a temporary deal expires in\nmid-August. Earlier this month, China reported that its producer price index\nfell the most in nearly two years in June, the 33rd straight month of factory\ndeflation.\n\nPersistent weakness in China’s housing market has also renewed calls for more\nstimulus from the central government. New home prices in 70 cities nationwide\nfell 0.27% in June month on month, while values for existing homes fell 0.61%,\nthe statistics bureau reported Tuesday. Residential sales dropped 12.6% in June\nfrom a year earlier, the sharpest decline this year, according to Bloomberg. The\ndata showed that China’s property slump—now in its fifth year—continues to weigh\non consumer demand.\n\nOTHER KEY MARKETS\n\nINDONESIA\n\nCENTRAL BANK OFFICIALS REDUCE INTEREST RATES, WELCOME U.S. TRADE DEAL\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. and Indonesia\nhad reached an agreement on trade and tariffs. According to Reuters, the U.S.\nset a tariff rate of 19% for Indonesian exports to the U.S. This was much lower\nthan the 32% that was initially proposed by Trump back in April before he agreed\nto a 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs. Reuters also reported that Trump\nclaimed that Indonesia had agreed to buy 50 airplanes made by aerospace giant\nBoeing and to spend USD 15 billion for U.S. energy supplies, as well as USD 4.5\nbillion for agricultural goods.\n\nWhile central bank officials reportedly welcomed the trade agreement with the\nU.S., in a separate action, they decided to reduce their benchmark interest rate\nfrom 5.50% to 5.25% following their July 15–16 policy meeting. They deemed their\ndecision to be “consistent with the lower inflation forecast for 2025 and\n2026…the maintenance of the stability of the rupiah exchange rate in accordance\nwith its fundamentals, and the need to continue to encourage economic growth.”\n\nPERU\n\nWITH ECONOMIC ACTIVITY “AROUND ITS POTENTIAL LEVEL,” CENTRAL BANK KEEPS RATE\nUNCHANGED\n\nOn July 10, the Peruvian central bank held its scheduled monetary policy\nmeeting, and policymakers decided to keep the reference rate at 4.50%. This\ndecision was generally expected.\n\nAccording to the post-meeting statement, policymakers based their decision on\nseveral observations and projections. They noted that year-over-year inflation\nremained at 1.7% in June, while core inflation declined from 1.8% in May to 1.7%\nin June. Also, policymakers acknowledged that inflation expectations have\nincreased in several major economies, especially in the U.S., due to “trade\ntensions.” This led policymakers to conclude that “the projected convergence of\ninflation toward its target may be slower than expected.” In contrast, 12-month\nforward inflation expectations in Peru were steady at 2.3% in June, which\ncentral bank officials noted is in their inflation target range.\n\nImportant Information\n\nThis material is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended to\nbe investment advice or a recommendation to take any particular investment\naction.\n\nThe views are as of the date written and are subject to change without notice;\nthese views may differ from those of other T. Rowe Price affiliated companies\nand/or associates.\n\nThis information is not intended to reflect a current or past recommendation\nconcerning investments, investment strategies, or account types, advice of any\nkind, or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any securities or investment\nservices.

This enabled retailers to maintain prices as they dipped into\n   existing inventories. Yet that is now starting to change. the US government\n   recently released data on inflation in June. It showed that inflation\n   accelerated for the second consecutive month, with prices of some durable\n   goods rising sharply. This was most likely due to tariffs.\n\nThe Yale Budget Lab that, currently, the average tariff rate for the United\nStates is 20.6%, the highest since 1910, and much higher than the 3% at the\nstart of this year. The tariffs include a 55% duty on many imports from China,\n25% on most automobiles, 50% on steel and aluminum, and a 10% baseline tariff on\nmost countries. Tariffs affect consumer prices in two ways: First, many consumer\nproducts are directly imported. Importers must pay a duty and, in many cases,\nwill pass that additional cost onto consumers in the form of higher prices.\nSecond, imported components and commodities are used by US-based companies to\nproduce goods and services. They pay a duty that they can also pass onto their\ncustomers in the form of higher prices.\n\nThe Yale Budget Lab estimates that, if all current tariffs are fully passed onto\nconsumers, prices will rise 2.1% from their baseline. Given that inflation has\nbeen running above 2%, this suggests that overall inflation could rise to above\n4% in the coming year. Moreover, the US administration has proposed additional\ntariffs to start on August 1. If these tariffs are implemented, the average\ntariff rate will be significantly higher while the inflationary impact will\nlikely be greater.\n\nIn any event, let’s consider the latest inflation news. The from the government\nindicated that the consumer price index (CPI) was up 2.7% in June from a year\nearlier, up from 2.4% in May and 2.3% in April. Prices were up 0.3% from the\nprevious month, the biggest monthly gain since January. When volatile food and\nenergy prices are excluded, core prices were up 2.9% from a year earlier, the\nbiggest annual gain since February. Inflation remains relatively low, but the\ntrajectory has reversed as tariffs start to affect consumer prices.\n\nThe details are interesting. Many household products and appliances are imported\nfrom China. With very high tariffs applied to imports from China, it is not\nsurprising that prices of some of these products surged in June. For example,\nprices of appliances were up 2.3% from May to June, while prices of window and\nfloor coverings were up 4.2% and prices of nonelectric cookware were up 4%.\nPrices of audio equipment were up 2.9%. These are very large monthly increases\nthat likely result from tariffs. Prices of durable goods were up 0.5% from the\nprevious month and up 0.6% from a year earlier. The latter number was the\nhighest since November 2022. Recall that, for a long time, prices of durables\nwere steadily declining.\n\nIt is likely that, in the coming months, consumer prices will accelerate further\nas the cost of tariffs is passed onto consumers. The latest data, as well as the\nexpectation of acceleration, likely mean that the Federal Reserve will keep\ninterest rates unchanged for a while. Currently, in a 73% probability of two\ninterest rate cuts by the Fed by the end of the year, with one cut in October\nand one in December. Investors likely believe that the Fed will see the\ninflationary impact of tariffs to be transitory. Rather, investors might believe\nthat the Fed will be concerned about the negative impact of tariffs on economic\nactivity. After all, as prices rise and wages fail to rise commensurately,\nhousehold purchasing power will decline, thereby hurting real\n(inflation-adjusted) consumer spending.\n\nMeanwhile, there have lately been about potential administration efforts to push\nFed Chair Powell out of power, likely to be replaced by someone committed to\ninterest-rate reductions. President Trump has that the Federal Funds rate be cut\nby 300 basis points. That is not likely to happen under any Fed Chair, but if\ninvestors perceive the Fed to be influenced by the administration it would\nlikely lead to higher bond yields. In response to the inflation report, the\nyield on increased 60 basis points, the value of the dollar increased, and\nequity prices were relatively stable.\n\nUS MONETARY POLICY IS UNDER A MICROSCOPE\n\n * The US administration wants low interest rates and has reportedly discussed\n   replacing Fed Chair Powell. When the news of this discussion broke, equity\n   prices fell, bond yields increased, and the value of the dollar fell sharply.\n   Since then, equities have rebounded, bond yields have declined, and the\n   dollar has regained some ground. While equities and bond yields returned to\n   their previous levels, the dollar did not.\n\nReplacing Powell would not guarantee lower short-term interest rates. The\nFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which controls short-term rates, consists\nof 12 voting members, and my sense is that the committee would be averse to such\na policy shift. If Powell is dismissed as chairman but chooses not to give up\nhis seat on the board, then President Trump would have to appoint a new chairman\nfrom among the existing board members.\n\nIn addition, if there were to be a perception that the Federal Reserve’s\nindependence had been compromised, it would likely lead to higher longer-term\nrates because of higher inflation expectations. This would have a negative\nimpact on some interest-sensitive sectors of the economy.\n\nMeanwhile, leaving aside the issue of who sits in the chairman’s seat at the\nFed, there is a way that the administration could drive down short-term rates.\nAnd that is to cut tariffs. That is not simply my opinion. That is what we’ve\nheard from Fed officials. In fact, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of\nNew York, John Williams, who is the second most powerful Fed official after\nPowell, that he is reluctant to support lowering interest rates because of\ntariffs. Specifically, he said, “For items that are more exposed to higher\ntariffs ... price increases so far this year have been well above what one would\nexpect based on past trends.” Therefore, he concluded, “maintaining this\nmodestly restrictive stance of monetary policy is entirely appropriate.” As\ninflation accelerates due to tariffs, which is likely to happen, the big\nquestion for the Fed will be whether the increase in inflation is transitory.\nThe Fed’s view on that issue will partly determine the direction of interest\nrates.\n\nIt is notable that, in the past three weeks, the , which is a measure of bond\ninvestor expectations of average inflation over the next five years, has risen\nabout 200 basis points. It is now at the highest level since just prior to the\npresident’s announcement of large tariffs in early April. This rise corresponds\nwith recent discussion about the possibility of removing Powell. Notably,\nlong-term inflation expectations fell after the April announcements as investors\nexpected a weaker economy to generate less inflationary pressure.\n\nCHINESE ECONOMIC DATA POINT TO MODEST STRENGTH\n\n * China’s economy has been supported by government stimulus measures while\n   exports to the United States have been hurt by tariffs. On balance, however,\n   the Chinese economy appears to be doing well, according to the latest data\n   released by the Chinese government. Let’s look at the data.\n\nThe that, in the second quarter of 2025, real GDP was up 5.2% from a year\nearlier and up 1.1% from the previous quarter. This was attributed to strong\nexport growth (even though exports to the United States fell sharply), healthy\nretail sales, and strong growth of manufacturing output. However, fixed asset\ninvestment faltered, largely due to a very sharp decline in property investment.\nThe 5.2% figure was a slight deceleration from the first quarter but better than\nmany analysts expected.\n\nGoing forward, the government is likely to continue efforts to boost domestic\ndemand through a combination of monetary and fiscal stimulus. Fiscal measures\nhave included subsidized trade-in programs for appliances. As for monetary\npolicy, the deputy governor of the central bank (the People’s Bank of China, or\nPBOC) said that “monetary policy operates with a lag, and the full impact of\ncurrent measures is still unfolding. The PBOC will continue to implement a\nmoderately loose monetary policy.” On the other hand, some analysts believe that\nmonetary policy has not been effective in that lower interest rates are not\nboosting credit activity as businesses and households choose to hoard cash. Of\ngreater importance are structural reform measures meant to encourage households\nto spend more and save less.\n\nMeanwhile, the government also reported that were up 4.8% in June versus a year\nearlier. Although this was the slowest retail sales growth since February, it\nwas a healthy pace given very low inflation. It was helped by government\nsubsidies for appliance trade-ins, with sales of appliances up 32.4% in June\nversus a year earlier.\n\nIn addition, China’s was up 6.8% in June versus a year earlier. This was the\nsecond fastest growth since February 2024. The manufacturing component grew\n7.4%. This included growth of 11.4% for automobiles, 11% for computers and\ncommunication, and 10% for railway and shipbuilding. On the other hand, in the\nfirst half of 2025 was up only 2.8%. Although investment in manufacturing was up\n7.5%, investment in property fell 11.2%. The latter reflects the continuing\ntroubles in the residential property market.\n\nTHE LATEST ON TRADE RULES\n\n * President Trump that he intends to impose a 30% tariff on all imports from\n   the European Union (EU) and a 30% tariff on imports from Mexico. He said\n   these rates will take effect on August 1. With respect to the EU, the\n   proposal comes after weeks of negotiations between the United States and EU.\n   In response to the latest proposal, the EU chose to postpone retaliatory\n   tariffs in the hope that an agreement can be reached before August. Still, it\n   was reported that the EU is considering tariffs on imports of US services.\n   European fell sharply following the tariff news.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen that tariffs “would disrupt\nessential transatlantic supply chains, to the detriment of businesses,\nconsumers, and patients on both sides of the Atlantic.” She left open the\npossibility of retaliation. In his letter to the EU, President Trump demanded\nthat the EU end all tariffs on imports from the United States, “in an attempt to\nreduce the large trade deficit.”\n\nMeanwhile, the that trans-Atlantic trade could be seriously disrupted by such a\nhigh tariff. Maros Sefcovic said that “it will be almost impossible to continue\ntrading as we are used to in a transatlantic relationship. Transatlantic supply\nchains would be heavily affected on both sides of the Atlantic.” Italian Prime\nMinister Giorgia Meloni, who has a good relationship with Trump, said that “it\nwould make no sense to trigger a trade war between the two sides of the\nAtlantic.”\n\nRegarding Mexico, which is the largest trading partner of the United States,\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said, “I've always said that in these cases,\nwhat you have to do is keep a cool head to face any problem.” She suggested that\na deal can be reached, saying, “We're also clear on what we can work with the\nUnited States government on, and we're clear on what we can't.” Although the\ntariff on Mexico excludes goods covered by the free trade agreement between the\nUnited States, Mexico, and Canada, Mexico will still be subject to tariffs on\nsteel and aluminum.\n\n * Meanwhile, the United States reached a trade deal with Indonesia. In April,\n   when President Trump announced reciprocal tariffs on many countries,\n   Indonesia was set to face a US tariff of 32% on its US exports. The\n   reciprocal tariffs were postponed, first until early July and then until\n   August 1. Recently, it was announced that the United States will impose a 19%\n   tariff on imports from Indonesia. Meanwhile there will be a zero tariff on\n   Indonesian imports of US goods. In addition, Indonesia agreed to purchase\n   US$15 billion in US energy products, US$4.5 billion in agricultural goods,\n   and 50 jet airplanes. The deal is similar to the deal reached between the\n   United States and Vietnam. It is the fourth deal the United States has\n   reached (the other two are the United Kingdom and China). All deals involved\n   the United States retaining historically high tariffs. Although the United\n   States will now face zero Indonesian tariffs, most US goods already faced\n   tariffs of less than 5%.\n\nPresident Trump lauded the deal as a win for the United States. Indonesian\nPresident Prabowo said that “we have calculated, discussed everything. This is\nour offer. We cannot give more. I have to protect our workers.” For Indonesia,\nthe 19% tariff will be an obstacle to export growth. However, it is far better\nthan the proposed 32% tariff. The 19% tariff will be paid by US consumers and\nbusinesses. \n\nGiven that the deals reached so far involve high US tariffs but low tariffs from\nother countries, it appears that the principal focus of US trade policy is to\nreduce imports and boost exports. This represents a mercantilist view of trade\nin which employment in exporting industries is seen as the main benefit of\ntrade. Yet the traditional economic view is that trade is meant to boost\nconsumer spending power, lowering prices by creating more competition for\ndomestic producers. Plus, competition is meant to create greater efficiency and\nmore choices for consumers.\n\nMeanwhile, its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points. It cited low\ninflation, a stable currency, and a need to boost domestic demand. Indonesian\nequity prices rose in response. Although the 19% tariff will hurt Indonesian\nexporters, Indonesia has substantial trade with many other countries, with China\nbeing its largest trading partner and largest source of inbound\ninvestment. Indonesia is a major exporter of mineral and agricultural\ncommodities.\n\nThe commitment by Indonesia to purchase more US products is a form of managed\ntrade. That is, rather than allow free market forces to determine what is bought\nand sold, governments agree on specific quantities. The problem with managed\ntrade is that it can result in a suboptimal allocation of resources,\ninefficiency, potential corruption, and slower growth of productivity and\neconomic output.\n\n * \n * \n * \n\nTHE SURPRISING BEHAVIOR OF US EQUITY PRICES\n\n * There has been much discussion about the in the face of uncertainty and a\n   trade war. One explanation is that the decline in the value of the dollar has\n   boosted the dollar value of foreign earnings for US-based companies. This, in\n   turn, has a positive impact on company valuations. Moreover, the decline in\n   the dollar has surprised investors. After all, economic theory tells us that\n   increases in tariffs should lead to an increase in the value of the currency.\n   Instead, the opposite happened. This is likely due to capital flight from the\n   dollar overwhelming the impact of tariffs, thereby leading to currency\n   depreciation. Moreover, a cheaper dollar will boost the competitiveness of US\n   exports, also potentially boosting earnings.\n\nSome analysts note that, after having fallen sharply, , thereby negating the\nperformance gap with European equities. This is true when each country’s equity\nindices are evaluated in their own currencies. However, if European equities are\nevaluated in US dollars, they have performed better than US equities, given the\nrising values of the euro and the pound. This suggests that global investors are\nstill more pessimistic about US prospects than European prospects—likely the\nresult of anxiety about the trade wars.\n\nStill, why have US investors been relatively relaxed about the potential impact\nof trade conflict? Perhaps it is due to relative calm since late April. In fact,\nthe , having soared in April, is now back to a level last seen in\nFebruary—indicating a perception of only modest risk. However, with the latest\ntrade-related announcements and threats, it looks like the trade war is not\nreceding while uncertainty continues to prevail.\n\nPerhaps investors are optimistic about the impact of the “One Big Beautiful\nBill” on effective corporate tax rates. On the other hand, if the act leads to\nhigher borrowing costs than otherwise, corporations will be hurt. Finally,\nperhaps investors had expected the trade war to have caused negative economic\nconsequences by now. And yet, the US economy remains relatively healthy while\ninflation remains low. Indeed, in the coming five years remain relatively low.\nStill the negative consequences of the trade war might take time to show up.\n\nNotably, President Trump threatened a 200% tariff on pharmaceutical imports and\na —and yet the did not react. Evidently, many investors believe that Trump’s\nthreats are simply the opening move in a negotiation. Thus, some investors\nignore trade news and focus on other things. Still, investors seem to forget\nthat the president has left in place historically high tariff rates which, over\ntime, will likely have a negative impact on equities.\n\nInterestingly, not all investors ignored the president’s comments. —up roughly\n10% in the last two days. This is not trivial given that copper is used in a\nwide range of important products and industries. Moreover, if the 50% tariff is\nimplemented, it could lead to dramatic increases in the cost of producing many\nkey products. Yet a recent poll of equity traders found that the vast majority\nexpect the average US tariff rate to be below 18% after the August 1 deadline\nfor establishing tariff rates. This is relatively optimistic, especially given\nthat the average tariff rate now is roughly 18%. Even if the survey respondents\nare right, that still leaves tariffs at the highest level in 90 years. After\nall, the survey found that less than 5% of traders expect the average tariff\nrate to fall below 10%.\n\nFinally, traders appear to be ignoring the potential impact of tariff\nvariability and uncertainty. Since early this year, the trade environment has\ninvolved threats of tariffs, imposition of tariffs, reversals of tariffs, and\npostponement of tariff decisions. This makes it difficult to make strategic\ndecisions and to invest accordingly. It is likely that some companies are\npostponing decisions until there is greater clarity. If multiple companies\nchoose to delay, it can have a negative impact on overall business investment\nand, consequently, economic activity.\n\nIronically, with equity prices strong and bond yields and the dollar relatively\nstable, there is only modest pressure on the administration to reverse course on\ntariffs. Recall that, in early April, following the announcement of very high\ntariffs, the US equity market plummeted, leading the administration to postpone\ntariffs while negotiations take place. Now, with final tariff rates said to be\ncoming before August 1, investors should be bracing for a shift in expectations.\n\nTHE TRADE WAR IS RENEWED\n\n * The United States appears to be moving toward sustained, very high tariffs.\n   The three trade deals reached so far (with the United Kingdom, Vietnam, and\n   China) have left US tariffs historically high, potentially offering a\n   template for future deals with many other countries. Although the United\n   States has postponed final determination of tariffs until August 1, the\n   framework for a new US relationship with the world is now emerging.\n\nJAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA\n\nPresident Trump sent letters to the leaders of South Korea and Japan indicating\nthat the United States intends to impose a from those countries unless they make\nunspecified changes to their trade policies. Under current law, the United\nStates and South Korea have a free trade agreement that took years to negotiate\nand was approved by the US Congress. New tariffs will end that agreement. This\nraises the question as to what concessions South Korea could make to appease the\nUS administration. In my view, there are none. Rather, the letter sent by the\npresident focuses on the bilateral US trade deficit with South Korea and urges\nKorean companies to invest more in the United States. The idea is that, if\nKorean companies make more things in the United States, they will export less to\nthe United States.\n\nA few comments on this: first, increased inbound investment in the United States\nnecessarily leads to a bigger trade deficit. That is because capital flows and\ntrade flows must offset one another. Second, the bilateral trade imbalance\nbetween two countries is not consequential. Rather, the overall trade imbalance\nof a country is important but is not the result of trade rules. Third, If Korea\ncannot make any meaningful concessions that would satisfy the United States,\nthen it will evidently be left facing a high tariff barrier for its exports.\nThis will surely hurt Korea’s economy, but it will hurt US consumers even more.\nAlthough it might lead US consumers to divert trade to other countries, this\nwould only make sense if tariffs are lower on other countries’ exports. That\nmight not be the case if the US imposes high tariffs on most countries.\n\nIn , it is reported that leaders are shaken by the US intention to impose a 25%\ntariff on imports. The country’s leaders had hoped that the expansive economic\nand political relationship between the two countries would protect Japan from\nsevere tariffs. Indeed, Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba recently said that “Japan\nis the world's largest investor in the United States and creates the largest\nnumber of jobs. We are in a different situation from other countries.”\nEvidently, that is not the case.\n\nTrump also announced , to take effect on August 1, provided no deal is reached\nwith these countries. He left open the possibility of deals, rendering the\nproposed rates highly uncertain. What we do know is that the rates are very\nhigh—in most cases similar to the so-called “reciprocal” tariffs announced on\nApril 2 but postponed. If these new rates are implemented, it would mean that\nthe average US tariff rate would reach a level not seen in more than a century,\nlikely disrupting global trade flows as well as cross-border investment flows.\nMoreover, these proposals say nothing about potential new tariffs on specific\nproducts that are currently being considered. Recall that a US court ruled that\nthe are mostly illegal. If this is upheld by higher courts, the administration\nis likely to turn to product-related tariffs as its principal tool.\n\nIf the average US tariff rate remains at the current level, or goes higher, it\nwill change the dynamics of the global economy. It will almost surely boost US\ninflation, at least temporarily. This, in turn, will influence the trajectory of\nthe Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. In addition, tariffs will lead to reduced\nimports and lower consumer purchasing power, likely causing US economic growth\nto decelerate and possibly leading to a US recession. For other countries, high\nUS tariffs will reinforce efforts to boost trade with one another and to boost\ndomestic demand. For some countries, retaliation will take place, as was\nsuggested last week by with respect to the European Union.\n\nSOUTHEAST ASIA\n\nRegarding Southeast Asia, it appears that the administration is leaning toward\nvery high tariff rates. This is important because, in recent years, much\ninvestment that might otherwise have gone into China went to Southeast Asia as\ncompanies sought to reduce the risk of doing business in China. Yet now it is\nreported that the US administration is considering tariffs ranging from from\nsuch countries as Cambodia, Laos, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, and\nMalaysia. If this happens, it will be significant for US consumers who purchase\nmany goods assembled in these countries. It could have a big negative impact on\nthese countries, likely disrupting existing supply chains.\n\nOn the other hand, this is not yet written in stone. Negotiations are taking\nplace. The US administration already reached a deal with Vietnam in which the\nUnited States imposes a 20% tariff on imports from Vietnam, and Vietnam imposes\na zero tariff on imports from the United States. It is not clear if this deal\nwill be a template for Vietnam’s anxious neighbors. Even a 20% tariff is very\nsignificant.\n\nLeaders in Southeast Asia have begun to react to the likelihood of high tariffs.\nFor example, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar criticized the new environment, that\n“across the world, tools once used to generate growth are now wielded to\npressure, isolate, and contain. Tariffs, export restrictions, and investment\nbarriers have now become the sharpened instruments of geopolitical rivalry.” cut\nits benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points—the first cut in 25 months—in an\nattempt to boost domestic demand and offset negative consequences for exports.\n\nCANADA\n\nUS-Canadian trade relations have returned to the top of the headline after\nseveral months of calm. Yesterday, US President Trump that a 35% tariff will be\napplied to imports from Canada, excluding goods covered by the free trade\nagreement between the two countries—although that exemption might be changed\naccording to the US administration.\n\nReaction in financial markets was mixed. US equity prices fell sharply before\nslightly rebounding, as did Canadian equity prices. The value of the Canadian\ndollar fell sharply but bounced back significantly due to expectations that the\n35% tariff will not necessarily happen. Many traders believe that each threat\nmade by the United States is simply an opening move in a negotiation. Yet the\nrecent resolution of trade disputes with other countries suggests that the\nUnited States intends to keep relatively high tariffs.\n\nThe 35% tariff on Canadian imports is more than the 25% rate threatened earlier\nin the year. Since then, Canada has gotten a new prime minister (Mark Carney)\nwho has worked hard to improve relations with the United States—going so far as\nto cancel a digital services tax about which the United States complained. Yet\nthe latest announcement suggested that the tariff is partly about fentanyl.\nPresident Trump said that “if Canada works with me to stop the flow of fentanyl,\nwe will, perhaps, consider an adjustment to this letter. These tariffs will be\nmodified, upward or downward, depending on our relationship with your country.\nYou will never be disappointed with the United States of America.” Trump also\nwarned that, if Canada retaliates, the US tariff will go up further.\n\nAlthough the crossing the border from Canada to the United States has reportedly\nbeen small, the Canadian government has vowed to spend US$1 billion to curtail\nthe flow. Prime Minister Carney said that “vital” progress has been made on this\nfront. He said that he will work with the US administration to resolve any\ndifferences.\n\nMoreover, whatever happens regarding US-Canada relations will ultimately be\nreplaced by the required review of the existing free trade agreement between the\nUnited States, Mexico, and Canada. This review must take place in 2026. It is\nlikely that changes will be made to the agreement.\n\nBRAZIL\n\nWhen the US administration proposed severe, so-called reciprocal tariffs in\nearly April, the size of each country’s tariff depended on the size of its trade\nsurplus with the United States. For countries that had trade deficits with the\nUnited States, there was a baseline tariff of 10%. Brazil is one of the\ncountries that has a deficit with the United States. Yet yesterday, President\nTrump threatened to impose on imports from Brazil because the government is\nprosecuting former President Bolsonaro, who is accused of attempting a coup.\nThis is a tariff not based on any economic factor but, instead, on a political\none. Thus, the current US administration likely sees tariffs as the ultimate\ntool to pressure foreign governments, regardless of economic circumstances.\n\nIt is unlikely that Brazil will make any changes to satisfy Trump. In response\nto the US threat, the value of the Brazilian currency fell sharply while\nBrazilian equities declined as well. Moreover, if a 50% tariff is implemented,\nit will have a significant impact in the United States. Brazil is the largest\nsource of coffee for the country. sharply today on the news of the US threat. \n\nIn addition, Brazil is the third-largest purchaser of US steelmaking coal.\nBrazilian companies finish the coal and sell it back to the United States. Thus,\nfor US steelmaking companies, this will represent an increase in their costs.\nBrazil also exports many other products, including medium-sized airplanes, that\nare popular with US airlines for short-haul routes. Thus, the potential tariff\ncould be very impactful.\n\nCOPPER\n\nThe US administration said that a 50% tariff on copper imports will take effect\non August 1. Thus, it appears that the effective average US tariff, which is\ncurrently around 18%, is set to increase significantly by August. Recall that,\nat the start of the year, it was under 3%.\n\nRegarding , the country imports about 60% of the copper it consumes, with most\nof it coming from Chile, which has a free trade agreement with the United\nStates. About 40% comes from domestic mines or the recycling of scrap copper. In\nresponse to the threatened tariff, the price of copper has soared as companies\nhave sought to purchase quickly in anticipation of tariffs. Indeed, copper\ninventories in the United States have also soared, roughly doubling since the\nstart of the year. The latter is a concern in China, the world’s largest\nconsumer of copper. Meanwhile, diversified mining companies, which might see\ntheir US mines benefit from the tariffs, saw their share prices fall, given the\nlikely disruption of the global market.\n\nWHERE IS THE INFLATIONARY IMPACT OF TARIFFS?\n\n * When US tariffs were boosted significantly, it was widely expected that this\n   would lead to much higher prices of imported goods and thereby boost US\n   inflation. So far, this has not happened. As such, the US administration is\n   claiming victory. It notes, for example, that the export prices of Japanese\n   vehicles have fallen sharply as Japanese auto producers have cut prices in\n   response to tariffs with the goal of retaining market share. It means that\n   they will take a hit to their margins. President Trump that “import prices\n   are actually dropping, just like I always said they would. The fake news and\n   the so-called ‘experts’ were wrong again. Tariffs are making our country\n   boom.”\n\nCould it be that tariffs will not lead to higher prices? Probably not. Rather,\nit appears to be taking some time before the impact of tariffs feeds its way\nthrough supply chains to ultimately affect consumer prices. Moreover, it also\nappears that, initially, some producers are trying to retain market share by\nreducing their margins.\n\nMore importantly, when the prospect of tariffs increased following the election\nin November 2024, there was a temporary surge in imports into the United States\nin anticipation of tariffs. This led to a buildup of inventories into which\ncompanies are now dipping. Once excess inventories are depleted, the true\npricing impact of tariffs is likely to take hold."}

Elsewhere, Chinese stocks have\nrecovered more strongly than US shares since June, suggesting investors see\nBeijing’s latest stimulus measures as likely to boost China’s recovery.  \n\nInvestor concerns over a raft of US issues intensified from early April. Could\nthe country still finance its bulging current account deficit at 6% of GDP?\nWould President Trump’s unfunded tax cuts, high import tariffs, and squeeze on\nimmigration lead to larger fiscal deficits, a higher debt burden, and a slowing\neconomy? As ‘US exceptionalism’ faded, investors simultaneously sold US stocks,\nbonds and the dollar.\n\nA reassessment followed quickly, however, cutting short the sell-off. Treasury\ndata released on 17 July shows net foreign buying of US assets in May (see\nExhibit 1). The dollar, however, has remained weak. What explains the dichotomy\nbetween this stronger demand for US assets and a sagging dollar?\n\nEconomic fundamentals suggest ‘there is no alternative’ (TINA) to US assets in\nthe medium term. The clue is in the country’s balance of payments (BoP): the\ndeficit in its current account (which mirrors the shortfall in US savings) must\nbe offset by a surplus in its capital account. Those funds should be coming from\ncountries with current account surpluses (i.e., excess savings).\n\nWho are these countries?\n\nThe big ‘surplus four’ are China, the eurozone, Japan and Gulf Cooperation\nCouncil members1 whose sizeable domestic savings exceed demand for investments\nat home, meaning they are looking for external placement opportunities.\n\nAt the prevailing exchange rates, these four economies are running an aggregate\ncurrent account surplus of about $1.3 trillion — almost equalling the US’s\ncurrent account deficit. That makes the US’s deep and liquid financial markets a\nnatural home to absorb such a large savings glut (see Exhibit 2).\n\n\n\nHistorically, these large savings surpluses have been recycled for the most part\ninto US assets. Given the lack of obvious alternatives, this will likely\ncontinue. If foreign countries (and by implication, investors) wanted to stop\nfunding the US deficit, they would have to address their current account\nsurpluses, which could be done by boosting domestic spending and investment.\n\nSince we would not expect such a global structural rebalancing to happen\nquickly, US assets look set to continue to be in demand.\n\nSo, if there is persistent demand for US assets, why is the dollar weak? The\nBank for International Settlements (BIS) argues in a June report\n[https://www.bis.org/publ/bisbull105.pdf] that an increase in hedging activity\nby non-US investors has been the main culprit, especially since April.\n\nForeign investors did not hedge dollar risk for most of the post-pandemic period\nbecause high US interest rates made hedging not worthwhile when the dollar was\nstrong. That has changed, however, since the start of this year, when the dollar\nstarted weakening as investors responded to higher US policy uncertainty.\n\nWith the dollar slumping, foreign investors in US assets boosted their hedging\nratios (which were low according to some estimates\n[https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w32453/w32453.pdf]) to\nmitigate against the risk of foreign exchange losses. A vicious dollar-hedging\ncycle could develop in the coming months as expected weakness in the US economy\nand more central bank interest rate cuts continue to weaken the dollar and\nprompt yet more hedging.\n\nMeanwhile, China’s stock market has recovered from the initial US import tariff\nshock with greater panache than the US market (see Exhibit 3).\n\nThis is partly the result of Beijing delivering on pledges for policy easing:\n70% of the planned fiscal stimulus of 1.5%-2.0% of GDP has already been\nimplemented in the first half of the year. That input helped sustain economic\ngrowth at 5.2% year-on-year in the second quarter after 5.4% in the first – even\nin the face of intensifying trade and geopolitical headwinds.\n\n\n\nThe question for investors is now how much more stimulus can be expected from\nChina’s authorities. Given the sticky deflation — the GDP deflator fell by 1.3%\nannualised in the second quarter — and China’s fragile economic recovery, it\nappears that Beijing fully intends to deliver on the remaining part of its\nplanned fiscal stimulus in the form of more consumer subsidies and new measures\nto stabilise the property market.\n\nThe People’s Bank of China (PBoC) is expected to provide support by cutting\ninterest rates by 20-30bp in the rest of this year. Faced with more challenges\nin the coming months, Beijing says it is also prepared to increase fiscal\nstimulus by a further 0.5% of GDP. This would be funded by special government\nbonds.\n\nContinued stimulus should allow Greater China stocks to recover further. The key\npolicy development to watch is whether Beijing shifts towards more social\ntransfers and consumption support rather than boosting capital spending. Recent\nstatements suggest it may make that policy shift.\n\n[1] The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is composed of six member states located\nin the Persian Gulf region of the Middle East: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,\nSaudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. \n\n\n\n"}

Retail sales excluding cars\nand fuel gained 0.5%, beating expectations and improving on the prior month’s\nreading. Non-farm payrolls increased by 147,000, more than in May and better\nthan forecast. Finally, core inflation, while reflecting some impact of the US’s\nimport tariffs, rose by less than the consensus expectation.\n\nEquity market returns have reflected this. The tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 index\ngained 1.8% in the first weeks of the third quarter, which was double the\nadvance for the Russell 1000 Value index, but below the 3.7% for the Russell\n2000 index of small-cap stocks. We expect good results in the coming corporate\nearnings season, which should support additional gains in the indices.\n\nIt is exactly when markets appear so content (both the VIX and MOVE indices,\nwhich track expected volatility in stocks and bonds, respectively, are below\naverage), that one should begin to worry.\n\nThe first thing to consider is that not all the economic data has been as\npositive as portrayed.\n\nHalf the increase in June’s non-farm payrolls was in the government sector;\nprivate payrolls rose by far less, by just 74,000, which was well below the\n121,000 average over the preceding year.\n\nMoreover, the vast majority of the jobs that were created were in the healthcare\nand social assistance sector (see Exhibit 1). While certainly valuable, these\njobs are more curative/administrative than productive, raising doubts about the\neconomy’s longer-term growth potential. This imbalance is not new – it has been\nevident for at least a year.\n\n\n\nAnd while retail sales did improve, the average gain over the second quarter of\n2025 was lower than in the first quarter (see Exhibit 2). This is worrying as\nthe personal consumption expenditures (PCE) component of GDP rose by just 0.1%\nin the first quarter, marking the slowest pace since the Covid pandemic. It is\nalso far below the rate in 2024.\n\nSome deceleration in consumer demand was expected this year as excess household\nsavings were run down, but this appears to be happening rapidly. The retail\nsales figure for the second quarter suggests that consumer demand – the primary\ndriver of US growth – could again be poor when second-quarter GDP figures are\nreleased at the end of July.\n\nThis weakness in consumer demand could be exacerbated as tariff price increases\nshow up more and more in the shops. The impact of the tariffs so far has been\nmodest: year-on-year core inflation rose from 2.8% to 2.9% in June, but remained\nbelow the 3.1% rate seen in February.\n\nThe inflation sub-indices that gained the most, however, are those where the\ntariff impact would be expected to be the highest, for example, appliances and\nclothing.\n\nAs prices rise further, consumer demand could falter.\n\nTo what extent this will happen, however, is unclear. Where domestically\nproduced, cheaper substitutes are available, consumers may simply switch,\nmeaning that even if prices rise for some goods, there would be little or no\nimpact on the prices actually paid by individuals.\n\nIn addition, prices may not go up by as much as the tariff being applied if\nproducers or retailers opt to absorb some of the cost. And in any event,\nimported goods account for just 11% of US consumption, according to a 2019 study\n[https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/economic-letter/2019/01/how-much-do-we-spend-on-imports/]\nby the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.\n\nThe financial market’s contentment appears to be partly premised on the\nassumption that the latest threats from President Trump of yet higher tariffs\nwill not be implemented, most likely because key trading partners such as the EU\nwill make sufficient concessions to make the threatened tariffs unnecessary.\n\nIf this turns out to be the case, US equities could get a further boost as these\nconcessions could entail improved market access and/or lower tariffs for US\nexporters.\n\nThe earnings reporting season has started well, with 7% earnings surprises so\nfar according to analysis by Factset.\n\nJust as importantly, the mood among CEOs is good, with the share of positive\nguidance on future earnings above average and rising. This is in contrast to the\nfirst quarter, particularly after the ‘Liberation Day’ tariff announcement, when\nsentiment deteriorated sharply (see Exhibit 3).\n\n\n\nIt is worth bearing in mind that import tariffs are positive for at least some\nUS domestic producers. And even for those who suffer from the levies, there may\nbe other – sufficiently positive – factors such as deregulation, lower energy\nprices, and mergers and acquisition opportunities to keep them optimistic on the\noutlook.\n\nThe Trump administration’s unorthodox economic policies have prompted some\ninvestors to question the appeal of US assets, from equities to Treasuries and\nthe dollar.\n\nThere are doubts about the long-run growth prospects of the economy and the\nwillingness of the government to pay back its significant debts to bondholders.\nThe US counts on foreign investment to finance its large current account\ndeficit.\n\nThere was some evidence of this change in foreign investor sentiment in the\nApril foreign flows data, which showed a rare month of net sales of US assets.\nThe redemptions were large in absolute terms, though not so significant as a\npercentage of total foreign holdings of US securities.\n\nThe most recent data, however, paints a rather different picture. Not only did\ninflows into US assets resume in May, but the total for the month was the\nhighest ever, partly thanks to significant inflows from Canada (see Exhibit 3).\n\nThis includes purchases not only of US Treasuries (at a 4.4% average yield for\nthe month versus 4.3% in April, so investors were not being attracted by a\nmeaningfully higher yield). It also includes equities, indicating a high level\nof investor conviction in the ability of US corporates to continue generating\nsuperior earnings growth in the future.\n\n"}

Every week, Talking Heads will bring you in-depth insights and\nanalysis on the topics that really matter to investors. In this episode, we’ll\nbe discussing the US dollar. I’m Daniel Morris, Chief Market Strategist, and I’m\njoined today by John Bradley, Head of Currencies. Welcome, John, and thanks for\njoining me.\n\nJohn Bradley, Thank you very much for having me.\n\nDM: If we think back to November 2024, there was a consensus trade post the [US]\nelection, besides being overweight US equities, being overweight the US dollar.\nWe anticipated stronger growth in the US, higher interest rates, tariffs being\nbeneficial at least on a relative basis for the dollar. So, tell us what’s been\ndriving the weakness of the US dollar in 2025, and do you expect it to continue?\n\nJB: What took the market by surprise was when the Trump administration\naggressively started to talk up broad-based tariffs. That became a big headwind\nfor growth in the United States and also had a higher inflation implications.\nThat combined to create a headwind for the dollar. And that occurred in an\nenvironment where the market was very long dollar assets. What we saw is that\nthese purchases of dollar assets had largely been unhedged. In March and April,\nwe started to see big unwinds of those long dollar positions, a sea change in\nperceptions around the desirability of owning long dollar assets, especially in\nan environment where US growth expectations had started to wane. Combining with\nthat, we have seen some response outside the US: fiscal stimulus coming out of\nGermany. We’ve seen rotation back into local assets and a big increase in\nhedging of US exposures.\n\nDM: You talked about the expectation that the high tariffs would have a big\nimpact on US growth, potentially pushing up inflation. The interesting thing is\nthat so far, honestly, we haven’t really seen that. Nonetheless, most investors\nare expecting it’ll arrive at some point, which then leads us to the outlook.\nWhat currencies do you think can outperform the dollar in the second-half of\n2025?\n\nJB: The currencies that we think can trade best in this environment are\ncurrencies [that] are going to see inflows either because people want to own\nthose assets or because it’s been driven by hedging of US exposure. The\ncurrencies we really like are those in countries that have big positive current\naccount positions and also very positive net international investment positions,\ncountries that see large foreign ownership of assets. Those are typically\nScandinavian currencies in Europe, so Norway and Sweden, but also Switzerland,\nJapan and to a lesser extent, Europe. Among those, we really have favoured\nEurope. In Europe not only do you have these repatriation flows and the hedging\nof US assets, but there’s also desirability to own European assets. They have\nlarge liquid equity and fixed income markets. They provide an alternative to\ndollar assets. In addition, we are seeing fiscal stimulus from Germany. It has a\nvery low debt to GDP ratio. It is seen as a country that has the scope to\nincrease fiscal spending in a responsible way. One of the headwinds for the\ndollar over the coming quarters will be the fact that you have a very large\nfiscal deficit, looking at 7% of GDP. That can create pressure on longer-end US\nfixed income and be a dollar negative.\n\nIn addition, we do continue to like the Japanese yen. It’s more of a waiting\ngame there. Unfortunately, the Bank of Japan has been very slow to hike rates.\nAnd so, the yield differential between US assets and Japanese rates is very\nlarge. It’s currently a little over 4%. In that environment, it’s expensive for\nthe Japanese to hedge their US exposures. For the yen to begin to rally, one of\nthe prerequisites will be for the [US] Federal Reserve to start cutting interest\nrates. We think that will happen sometime in the second-half of the year. But it\nmight be a longer wait.\n\nDM: We look outside of developed markets and think about emerging markets. Now,\non one hand, you worry about growth given the US tariffs. A lot of countries in\nsoutheast Asia rely on exports to the US as a primary driver of growth. That\nmodel is going to be challenged. What are the implications for EM currencies? Do\nyou see any interesting opportunities?\n\nJB: We’re more bullish on emerging market currencies than we have been for quite\nsome time. Historically when you enter a weak dollar market, that’s usually a\nbullish environment for emerging market assets, specifically, fixed income\nmarkets and equities. That creates a positive reinforcement for the currency.\nLower yields drive bond inflows from foreigners and also make local equity\nmarkets more attractive. So, you see inflows into equity markets – that\nstrengthens the currency, which allows the central banks to cut rates more. You\nget this positive dynamic that that can really feed into currency strength. We\ndo prefer at the moment higher-yielding Latam currencies, specifically Mexico,\nBrazil, and the South African rand. We’re entering a virtuous cycle there.\n\nIn non-Japan Asia, it’s more complicated. A lot of the currencies have big\ncurrent account surpluses and big positive net international investment\npositions, but they have big trade exposures to the US. So, there could be\nheadwinds on the trade front. For some of these currencies, as part of the trade\ndeal with the United States, there will be some agreement to allow the\ncurrencies to appreciate, specifically, in non-Japan Asia. We continue to like\n[South] Korea [and] tactically trade Taiwan. It‘s a relatively small market and\ncan be fairly liquid. It’s a currency that has some scope to appreciate.\n\nDM; If I can highlight some of the key points, we talked about the dollar being\none of the big consensus trades, a crowded trade. When you had a trigger, in\nparticular the announcement of much higher tariffs than investors expected, it\nwas a perfect storm to use an analogy for a change in how the dollar was moving.\nMore recently, the big, beautiful bill [was] arguably another factor that’s\ngoing to promote dollar weakness. If you look to what currencies you do like,\nyou mentioned Scandinavian currencies, the Swiss currency, the euro, Japan, but\nyou also are more positive towards EM currencies. Well, John, thank you very\nmuch for joining me.\n\nJB: It’s my pleasure.\n\nDM: That’s it for this week’s episode of Talking Heads.

However, markets will likely\nneed to see that such measures are sustained over time before they react\nmeaningfully.\n\nThe non-farm payroll report for June\n[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm] showed a surprisingly strong\nUS labour market with 147,000 jobs created in June compared to consensus\nforecasts for around 106,000. In addition, there were upwards revisions to the\nnumbers for prior months. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.1% despite market\nexpectations for a rise to 4.3%.\n\nOne surprise in the report was the significant increase in government hiring (up\n73,000 – half the total). Over the last three months, private hiring has\naveraged 115,000, which is not that much lower than the pace over the previous\n12 months of 122,000.\n\nMarkets reacted to this reassuring employment data by lowering to around 5% the\nprobability of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its next monetary\npolicy meeting on 29-30 July. With no policy meeting in August, the Fed will now\nhave the summer to further assess the impact of tariffs on the US economy.\n\nThe main data release in the eurozone was the harmonised indices of consumers\nprices (HICP) on 1 July\n[https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-euro-indicators/w/2-01072025-ap]. As\nexpected, headline inflation increased slightly to 2%. Data for core inflation\nwas stable at 2.3%. Overall, the print was much as expected.\n\nAt its latest monetary policy meeting, the European Central Bank revised down\nits forecasts for headline inflation in 2026 from 1.9% to 1.6%, below its policy\ntarget of 2%.\n\nOver the last month, there has been a rise in disinflationary forces impacting\nthe eurozone economy.  These include an increase in imports from China,\nreflecting overcapacity in the country. There are concerns that deflationary\npressure is becoming endemic across Chinese industry.\n\nChina’s President Xi Jinping last week warned against ‘disorderly’ price\ncompetition, and state and Communist party media have stepped up calls against\nwhat they call ‘involution’, or destructive price wars. With access to the US\nmarket increasingly restricted by tariffs on Chinese exporters, Europe may find\nitself confronted with a wave of cheap Chinese goods driving down prices,\nabetted by the strength of the euro.\n\nThe US dollar was weak in the first half of 2025. President Trump’s stop-start\ntariff war, investor concerns over the US government’s sizeable borrowing needs,\nand worries about the continued independence of the Federal Reserve have\nincreasingly led overseas investors to hedge their exposure to dollars\n[https://www.bis.org/publ/bisbull105.pdf], contributing to its depreciation\nagainst other currencies.\n\nThe euro has risen by around 14% against the dollar so far in 2025, reaching its\nhighest level in nearly four years.\n\n At the ECB’s three-day annual conference in Sintra, Portugal, last week, ECB\nvice-president Luis de Guindos talked about the need to ‘avoid any sort of\novershooting’ of the euro’s exchange rate. He said the ECB could look past the\ncurrent exchange rate of around $1.18, but levels beyond $1.20 ‘would be much\nmore complicated’.\n\nThe strength of the euro is making imports cheaper, while raising the prices of\neurozone exports. This dynamic may have potentially significant disinflationary\nconsequences for the eurozone economy, above and beyond the outcome of tariff\nnegotiations. \n\nIn June, ECB president Christine Lagarde said the central bank had ‘nearly\nconcluded’ the latest monetary policy cycle, which has seen policy rates fall\nfrom a peak of 4% in June 2024 to 2%. No rate cut is expected at the policy\nmeeting on 24 July before the ECB’s summer break in August.\n\nWe anticipate the ECB will cut policy rates further this year to counteract\ndisinflationary forces.\n\n"}
{"article_title": "Weekly Market Update – The US Treasury yield/dollar value conundrum", "publish_date": "2025-07-02", "url": "https://www.bnpparibas-am.com/en-sg/institutional/front-of-mind/weekly-market-update-the-us-treasury-yield-dollar-value-conundrum/", "source": "BNP Paribas", "content": "Despite conflict in the Middle East and risks of trade wars, yields of US\nTreasuries have risen while the US dollar has depreciated. Both bonds and the\ncurrency normally benefit from investor demand in troubled times. Does this\nyield/dollar conundrum mean US assets are losing their safe-haven status?\nPerhaps, but there is more to it than meets the eye.\n\nListen to the article\n\n\n\nUS Treasury yields usually tend to move in unison with the dollar: strong US\ngrowth tends to lift valuations of both assets, and vice versa. Put another way,\nhigher US bond yields attract capital, which strengthens the dollar. However,\nthis correlation broke down early this year (see Exhibit 1).\n\nSince financial markets are not pricing in any major disruptions of oil supply\nor a protracted Middle East conflict, there have been few safe-haven flows into\ndollar assets. It is also possible that, if an oil price spike were sustained\nand pushed up inflation, it would boost bond yields. Indeed, US yields have\ncrept higher and remained range bound since January as rising geopolitical\nturmoil threatens to boost oil prices and inflation.\n\nTreasury yields may now be kept high by the US Federal Reserve’s reluctance to\ncut interest rates.\n\nMeanwhile, the dollar is reacting to expectations of \n\n\n\nFinally, the high-yield/low dollar conundrum may reflect investor concerns over\nthe surge in the US fiscal deficit and national debt should President Donald\nTrump’s ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ be enacted.\n\nWe argue that the decoupling between Treasury yields and dollar movements\nappears to reflect the cross-currents behind the growth-inflation dynamics that\nhave left the Fed between a rock and a hard place, resulting in policy inaction\nand financial market volatility.\n\nNevertheless, we believe interest rate cuts remain on the cards. The question is\nthe timing. Fed Chair Jerome Powell delivered his semi-annual report to Congress\non 25 June\n[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20250624a.htm] and\nreiterated monetary policy was well positioned and that the Fed will wait and\nsee before making any adjustments – despite remarks from policymakers Bowman and\nWaller about a possible rate cut in July.\n\nWhile the level of the ‘reciprocal’ tariffs from ‘Liberation Day’ on 2 April\nseems to have been watered down, it is still unclear what the final levies will\nbe as trade negotiations continue with various countries.\n\nHindsight of the 2018-19 Sino-US trade spat shows that import tariffs would push\nup inflation about three months after implementation.\n\nFor now, the outlook for growth and inflation remains cloudy for the Fed. As to\nthe Fed’s dual mandate of full employment and stable prices, the risk now\nappears to be that the US labour market could fall short of the Fed’s objective,\nin which case inflation will likely ease even in the face of Trump’s tariffs.\n\nLabour market softening has been evident from the steady decline in the ratio of\njob vacancy-to-unemployed since the peak in 2023, and the slowdown in labour\ncost growth (see Exhibit 2).\n\n\n\nAlthough non-farm payrolls grew by more than expected at 139,000 in May, the\nnumbers for the preceding two months were revised down by a sharp 95,000,\nleaving a net gain of just 44,000 new jobs.\n\nFor context, we note the one-time effect of (higher) tariffs on prices will drop\nout of the data after one year. To generate sustainably higher inflation,\ntariffs would have to rise every year and become embedded in long-term inflation\nexpectations.\n\nHowever, there has been no indication that President Trump will keep raising\ntariffs and, given the softening of the labour market, long-term inflation\nexpectations have been falling this year (see Exhibit 3).\n\nWhile the US and China in June agreed on a trade negotiation framework, it is\nunlikely to change the prospects of weak US growth and higher inflation into\n2026. The accord appears more of a tactical measure to de-escalate tensions than\na long-term resolution of deep distrust between the two countries.\n\nThe relatively weaker outlook for US growth will likely keep downward pressure\non the US dollar and Treasury bond yields until the outlook changes. Tariffs are\nalso creating greater uncertainty over the path of inflation. They will cause\nthe yield curve to steepen: the long end is likely to reflect a premium for\ntariff uncertainty and worries over years of larger fiscal deficits should the\n‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ become law."}

This recovery came despite ongoing tariff\nchaos, erratic policy shifts from President Trump, and mounting concerns over\nthe United States’ gargantuan fiscal deficit.\n\nThis V-shaped recovery took many investors by surprise. Even if conflict in the\nMiddle East escalates and threatens volatility, the structural tailwinds we have\nlisted stay relevant and robust – barring any worst-case scenarios.\n\nHere, it is timely for me to reaffirm the old adage: “time in the market beats\ntiming the market”. Trying to exit and re-enter at a more favourable level is\neasier said than done. Behavioural biases – particularly “anchoring”, which\ndeters investors from buying back into the market at prices higher than their\nexit point – remains a perennial challenge.\n\nWe are clearly entering a new world order: one defined by self sufficiency and\nprotectionist trade policies, driven by apprehension over US debt\nsustainability. At the same time, AI-powered technologies are revolutionising\nthe way we live, work, and play.\n\nFor sure, these shifts have created headwinds as well as investment\nopportunities. Gold and technology equities remain strongly at the centre of our\nconviction call, alongside IG credit as a reliable source for income generation.\nFor deeper insight, refer to the special section in this publication, “New World\nOrder”.\n\nI wish you every success in building a resilient portfolio while seizing\nopportunities in this volatile market environment.\n\n "}

However, the country’s military capabilities have been severely crippled\nby airstrikes. Given the combined military capabilities of US and Israel, Iran\nknows this is a war which it has no chance of winning.\n\nLimited involvement from external parties: We do not envisage Iran’s key\nallies—Russia and China—to come to the country’s rescue in this conflict. Apart\nfrom rhetoric and grand political statements, putting military resources on the\nground in the Middle East will be out of question for these countries. Russia,\nfor instance, is stuck in a war with Ukraine and has limited spare military\ncapacity to be involved in Iran. More importantly, the strategic partnership\nwhich both countries signed this year is not a military alliance. Hence, Russia\nhas no obligation to come to its rescue. In the case of China, the country is\nsaddled by domestic economic issues and the ongoing tariff war with US. Its\npartnership with Iran is driven predominantly by economic interest (i.e. Iranian\noil and access to the Strait of Hormuz) as opposed to strategic and ideological\nreasons. The lack of involvement from Russia and China will ensure that this\ncrisis is contained within the region.\n\nClosing the Strait of Hormuz – A case of economic self-harm: Another option for\nIranian retaliation will be the closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a trade route\nwhereabouts one-fifth of the world’s oil supply pass through daily. The strait\nlies between Iran and Oman and is one of the most important chokepoints for oil\nin the world. Iran uses the strait for its oil exports (in particularly to\nChina) and its closure will therefore amount to economic self-harm."}

The ECB has already cut rates by 200bps in this\ncycle and we argue that rates may already be close to, if not already below\nneutral. Notably, CPI readings in the Eurozone have been hovering around 2% and\ninflation expectations (as measured by 10Y breakeven) have stabilized at around\n1.75%. Accordingly, even if the neutral real rate is as low as zero, there may\nnot be much downside to nominal EUR rates from here on.

More than 20\ncountries have received tariff notification letters from the US president, but\naccording to the White House, Indonesia is the fourth country to conclude a\n“deal.” Indonesia has reportedly committed to purchase $15bn worth energy\nimports and $4.5bn worth agricultural goods from the US, besides stepping up\norders for aviation jets. US might tap into the country’s natural resource\nsupplies, including copper, with the government seeking better access to the\nonshore industries/ markets. Further details were scant at the time of writing,\nand there was lack of clarity on whether the terms had been agreed on bilateral\nbasis. Coordinating Minister Moegiaro was cited saying that the government plans\nto issue a joint statement with more information. US had flagged Indonesia’s\nnon-trade barriers, amongst others, as key sticking points during negotiations.\nTextiles, footwear, electrical equipment, and commodities are amongst key\nexports to the US, with the nominal export value in 2024 amounting to ~2% of\nIndonesia’s GDP. Indonesia is amongst the US’ top 25 trading partners, with the\ntrade surplus (with the US) recorded at $18bn last year.\n\nBank Indonesia meets today for its monthly rate review and is likely to weigh\navailable policy options. Domestic price developments have been conducive, with\nJune inflation at 1.9% yoy, well within the central bank’s target range.\nSelected food categories like chillies and rice added to the headline, besides\nairfares and precious metals, while sea/ rail transport tariffs receded on fare\ndiscounts announced for June-July. Core inflation flatlined at 2.4% yoy. While\nthe price outlook is conducive, policymakers are likely to draw direction from\ntheir reading of financial market action, with US Fed rate cut expectations\nfading after a firm inflation print. External caution is being counterbalanced\nby the fresh news over the trade deal. Our baseline expectation is for a rate\npause today, though the overnight conclusion of the trade deal will be positive\nfor IDR-denominated assets, increasing the possibility that the BI might bank on\nimproved sentiments to assert its dovish bias today. It is a close call. High\nfrequency activity indicators have been soft, including auto sales, consumer\nconfidence indices and manufacturing PMI readings, requiring policy to maintain\na dovish bent. We continue to expect at least 50bp cuts in 2H25. Concurrently,\nthe use of short-term securities i.e., SRBIs is being scaled back to redirect\ndemand towards short-end bonds, effectively steepening the yield curve. Return\non SRBI securities have eased to all-time lows, since the instrument was\nintroduced back in September 2023. Expectation of further rate cuts is likely to\nact as an additional tailwind for short-term papers.\n\n"}

The US Treasury 30Y yield fell for a fourth\nsession by 4.4 bps to 4.944% while gold prices rose 1.4% – its largest jump in\nsix weeks – on haven demand. Viewed against his earlier push for the Treasury\nDepartment to play a greater role in banking regulation, Bessent is seen\naligning Fed policy to US President Donald Trump’s fiscal and tariff agenda to\nadvance the MAGA platform. If so, markets will find it more difficult to shake\noff concerns over the Fed’s independence, given what appears to be a unified\nstrategy to bring monetary and financial governance under stronger executive\noversight. \n\nHowever, pushing for another steep decline in the DXY faces headwinds from\nJapan’s post-election uncertainty and anxiety over US-EU trade negotiations. \n\nThe JPY’s post-election rebound of 1% on Monday was seen as profit-taking on a\nwidely anticipated outcome – the Ishiba government’s loss of its Upper House\nmajority, which had already been priced in. While Prime Minister Shigeru\nIshiba’s pledge to remain in office offered temporary reassurance about\nstability ahead of critical trade talks with the US, it does not ease worries\nabout internal pressure within the Liberal Democratic Party to eventually\nreplace a leader who has lost the majority in both houses of parliament. While\nthe 10Y JGB yield has backed down from 1.60%, the market remains wary of more\nfiscal measures to address the opposition-led public discontent over inflation. \n\nThe EUR’s 0.6% appreciation to almost 1.17 was largely driven by broad USD\nweakness, triggered by Bessent’s call for a Fed review. However, the Trump\nadministration has also been vigilant against a further rapid decline in the\nUSD, which would undermine credibility and investor confidence in US financial\nmarkets. Some European Central Bank officials have also warned that further euro\nstrength beyond 1.20 could suppress inflation below the 2% target and pressure\nexports. US-EU trade talks are at a critical juncture ahead of the August\n1 tariff deadline. While both sides have emphasized the preference for a\ndiplomatic resolution, the high stakes and aggressive posturing also mean that\nfailure to find common ground could trigger a real tariff war, which would\nelevate economic risks and market disruptions. \n\n\nQuote of the Day\n”However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and\nsucceed at”\n     Stephen Hawking\n\nJuly 22 in history\nSarawak achieved independence from British colonial rule in 1963.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n "}

USD/JPY’s rise from 143 to 149 this month had priced in the ruling\nLiberal Democratic Party-Komeito coalition government losing its majority at the\nJuly 20 Upper House Elections. USD/JPY also took its cue from the 10Y JGB yield\nfalling below 1.55% after it failed to break above 1.60% for the third time this\nyear. The narrative has shifted from inflation optimism in March to missed CPI\nforecasts in May to concerns about recession in July. Beyond internal party\nleadership pressures, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s weakened position leaves\nhim facing greater hurdles in passing additional fiscal stimulus and any trade\ndeal agreed with the US. Let’s see if the Bank of Japan confirms market\nexpectations at its July 31 meeting, with a reduced appetite for another rate\nhike this year.\n\nThe DXY Index consolidated in a 98-99 range last week following its rise from\nthe year’s low of 96.4 on July 1. Given the Fed’s blackout period ahead of next\nweek’s FOMC meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell should refrain from commenting on\nmonetary policy in his opening remarks at the Fed’s conference on July 22. The\nDXY was also caught between US President Donald Trump’s discomfort with the\nUSD’s weakness this year and his increasingly vocal push for Powell’s\nresignation and significantly lower US rates. Trump’s plan to nominate a\nsuccessor to Powell has begun to expose political pressure on the Fed’s\npolicymaking process. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was reportedly\ncautioning Trump that markets could become volatile again if they see the Fed’s\nleadership transition turning into a political battleground.\n\nEUR/USD consolidated in a 1.1555-1.1700 range last week, following its sell-off\nfrom 1.1830 on July 1. EUR volatility has been limited despite the uncertain\nUS-EU trade talks. Both sides want to avoid an all-out tariff war before the\nAugust 1 deadline. The Financial Times reported that the US may push for a\n15-20% minimum tariff on all EU goods, down from the earlier threat of 30%.\nGiven the Trump administration’s recent discomfort with the USD depreciation, we\nreckon the European Central Bank will refrain from lowering rates at its July 24\nmeeting. Moreover, the deposit facility rate has halved to 2% since June 2024,\nwithin the 1.75-2.25% neutral range. Although ECB President Christine Lagarde\nsupports a greater global role for the EUR, other ECB officials have flagged\n1.20 as a level that could weigh on growth, exports, and inflation.\n\nUSD/SGD consolidated in a 1.2800-1.2880 range last week following its rise from\n1.27 at the start of July. We expect the Monetary Authority of Singapore to hold\noff a third reduction in the slope of the SGD NEER policy band at the July\npolicy review. Following a 0.5% QoQ sa contraction in 1Q25, the Singapore\neconomy averted a technical recession after real GDP growth expanded 1.4% in\n2Q25. On July 23, consensus expects CPI inflation to rise to 0.9% YoY in June\nfrom 0.8% in May and core inflation to 0.7% from 0.6%. We expect the SGD NEER,\ncurrently 1.6% above the mid-point of the band, to remain stable during Deputy\nPrime Minister Gan Kim Yong’s July 20-26 trip to the US to deepen economic and\ncommercial ties and seek tariff relief, especially on pharmaceuticals.\n\n\nQuote of the Day\n”Every new beginning comes from other beginning’s end.”\n    Seneca\n\nJuly 21 in history\nIn 2002, Telecom giant WorldCom filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the then\nlargest such filing in US history.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n "}

The market’s negative\nreaction, and an unprecedented string of appearances and statements by US bank\nCEOs emphasizing the independence of the Federal Reserve, have likely put a stop\nto Trump from taking further action, even as he expresses dissatisfaction over\nPowell. This Trump-driven tempest follows a string of USD gains since the start\nof July, and Trump’s unpredictable attitude to the sanctity of central bank\nindependence could keep a check on the USD’s advance now.\n\nUSD/JPY dipped from 149 towards 147 amid speculation over Powell’s fate, but the\nJPY is still broadly weaker ahead of Japan’s Upper House elections scheduled 20\nJuly. Support for the ruling LDP has dipped amid rising costs of living, and the\nopposition is campaigning to lower the consumption tax, which could lead to a\ndeterioration in the country’s fiscal position if enacted. Concerns over a poor\nelectoral showing for the LDP, higher fiscal pressures, and lesser political\nspace for trade negotiations with the US, have all acted to pressure the JPY and\nJGBs. Japan’s 20Y yield has surged over 20bps since the start of July, while the\nJPY has also been the worst performer across G10 and Asia on a month-to-date\nbasis. But there could be a relief rally in the JPY next week if LDP\nsuccessfully achieves its modest goal of keeping a majority of seats.

Hence, the\n6200 support level for the S&P 500 has become important. US President Donald\nTrump’s intensified efforts to oust Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his demand for\ninterest rates to drop to 1% (ahead of the July 30 FOMC meeting) could revive\nconcerns about the Fed’s independence. There is less complacency about\ntariff-driven inflation after US CPI inflation increased to 2.7% YoY in June,\nfollowing three months of steady readings around 2.3-2.4%.

His case is reinforced by\nTrump’s latest threat to impose higher reciprocal tariffs on August 1 for\ncountries that fail to strike trade deals with the US.\n\nAccording to median expectations, headline and core inflation are expected to\nincrease by 0.3% MoM in June, a significantly faster pace to May’s 0.1%. Since\nthe end of June, the futures market has reduced the odds of a 25 bps cut at the\nSeptember FOMC meeting to 60% from 90%. However, US President Donald Trump’s\nrepeated attacks on Powell also appeared to have dulled the DXY’s ability to\nrally meaningfully on diminished rate cut expectations.\n\n\n\nHowever, we do not expect currencies to react to any US CPI surprise in the same\nway they did to the July 3 jobs report. It is better to understand how the\ndynamics have changed for some currencies. For example, GBP turned from the most\nresilient on July 3 to the second worst performer because of two consecutive\nnegative GDP growth prints in April-May, increasing rate cut expectations at the\nBank of England meeting on August 7. AUD was the most resilient currency this\nmonth following the Reserve Bank of Australia’s surprise decision not to rush\ninto a rate cut at its July 8 meeting and to wait for the 2Q25 CPI inflation\nreport on July 30.\n\n\n\nThe JPY continued to underperform as markets priced in the risk of the ruling\nLDP-Komeito coalition losing its majority in the July 20 Upper House elections.\nSuch an outcome could add to JGB volatility amid expectations for more\nexpansionary fiscal policy and political resistance to further interest rate\nnormalization by the Bank of Japan amid difficult trade talks with the US for\nconcessionary tariff rates. Hence, it should not be a surprise that the CHF has\nenhanced its safe appeal in recent weeks, partly filling the gap left by the\nJPY’s underperformance.\n\n\nQuote of the Day\n”Pain makes man think.

The\nnext support level is around the significant 1.15 level. US President Donald\nTrump’s latest tariff threat – 30% on all EU goods starting August 1 unless a\ntrade deal is reached – represents a significant escalation from previous\nproposals. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen responded that the\nEU would also suspend countermeasures until early August and affirmed the bloc’s\npreference for a negotiated solution.\n\nAlthough both sides want to avoid an all-out trade war, the fundamental mismatch\nin their approaches towards a trade deal remains difficult. The EU prefers trade\ndeals that are rules-based, multilateral, and enforceable via the World Trade\nOrganisation, which clashes with Trump’s unilateralism and desire for quick and\nvisible political wins. Internal divisions are also hampering the EU’s response.\nExport-driven members like Germany and Ireland want a deal to protect autos and\nagriculture, while France and Belgium are resisting any concessions on food\nstandards and digital taxes.\n\nWe pay more attention to GBP/USD’s downside risks this week. Following its 1.7%\ndepreciation in the first fortnight of July, GBP/USD could extend its decline\nbelow the crucial 1.35 support level towards 1.3250, around its 100-day moving\naverage. The OIS market is pricing an 85% chance for the Bank of England BOE to\nlower rates at its August 7 meeting. Last week, UK GDP growth turned negative\nmonth-on-month for a second consecutive month in May. The Atlanta Fed GDPNow\nmodel expects US advance GDP growth to rebound to an annualized 2.6% QoQ saar in\n2Q25 after a 0.5% contraction in 1Q25. This week, UK CPI inflation out on July\n16 could halve to 0.1% MoM in June from 0.2% in May, keeping headline inflation\nunchanged at 3.4% YoY. On July 17, average weekly earnings are expected to slow\nfor a fourth straight month to 5% YoY in May from 6.1% high in December.\n\nThe JPY is bracing for volatility from Japan’s Upper House elections scheduled\nfor July 20. Polls indicated that the Liberal Democratic Party-Komeito ruling\ncoalition may lose its majority. On July 18, the expected decline in National\nCPI inflation to 3.3% YoY in June from 3.5% in May will not temper public\nfrustration over inflation and voter fatigue over the incumbent government’s\nhandling of economic issues.\n\nUSD/JPY has been bucking the DXY Index’s decline in June, when the Bank of Japan\nprioritized dampening the volatility in the JGB market by halving the bond\ntapering pace to JPY400 bn from FY2026-27. USD/JPY rose by 2.1% to 147.43 last\nweek, eyeing the top of its two-month range of 142-149.\n\nGiven how the stronger-than-expected US jobs report lifted the DXY Index this\nmonth, another upside surprise in this week’s US CPI inflation could have a\nsimilar effect by dampening near-term Fed cut expectations. Fed Chair Jerome\nPowell has been advocating patience in lowering rates, warning that tariffs\ncould lift inflation in the coming months. His case is reinforced by Trump’s\nlatest threat to impose higher reciprocal tariffs on August 1 for countries that\nfail to strike trade deals with the US.\n\n\n\nQuote of the Day\n\n”The least I can do is speak out for those who cannot speak for themselves.”\n\n    Jane Goodall\n\n \n\nJuly 14 in history\n\nIn 1960, Jane Goodall arrived at the Gombe Stream Reserve in present-day\nTanzania to begin her study of chimpanzees in the wild.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n "}

Countries and markets did not embrace the extension of the US tariff\npause to August 1 as they did the one to July 9. More nations have become less\noptimistic about achieving trade agreements with the Trump administration by the\nnew deadline to lower the unilateral reciprocal US tariffs, while legally\nblocked, are still politically operative.\n\nUS President Donald Trump’s trade letters to countries were not personal\ndiplomacy and signalled a hardening of the US trade posture instead. Each\nmass-produced unilateral tariff notice was tailored with a specific levy on\nAugust 1, delivered to put maximum pressure on trade partners to extract\nreciprocal concessions such as lower tariffs, fewer subsidies, and expanded\nmarket access for US goods. Every letter warned that any retaliatory tariffs\nwould trigger additional US duties, demanding compliance with US terms without\ncountermeasures. The explicitly transactional “deal or get punished” letters\nundermine the rules-based global trade environment.\n\nThe problem for US trade partners goes beyond coming to terms with the 10%\nuniversal tariff becoming the baseline for their goods to retain access into\nAmerica. China has firmly objected to the containment provisions in the new\nletters, such as rules of origin and strict traceability provisions, for some\ncountries. The letter’s overall approach has made US trade policy more coercive\nand conditional, blurring the lines between economic cooperation and\ngeopolitical alignments.\n\nFollowing the Rio Declaration at the BRICS Summit on July 6-7, Trump threatened\nto impose an additional 10% tariffs on nations that aligned with the group’s\n“anti-American” policy. Brazil rejected Trump’s 50% tariff threat as politically\nmotivated, linking it directly to internal Brazilian politics rather than as a\ntrade justification.

For example, ASEAN has become more vocal in rejecting\nunilateralism and coercive bilateral pressure. However, ASEAN is not pursuing a\npath of confrontation but is instead responding strategically by strengthening\nmultilateral ties with China, the EU, and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC);\nleveraging regional trade platforms like the Regional Comprehensive Economic\nPartnership (RCEP), and the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC); and collectively\nadvocating for WTO principles and diplomacy.

The 90-day\nreprieve saw a tentative stabilisation in sentiments, weakened the US dollar,\nperked global financial markets and delayed a knock-on impact on the real\neconomies. There has been a constant trickle of on-again off-again trade deal\ndiscussions and counter-tariff announcements. Trading partners have endured a\nbusy few weeks of travelling the Asia-Washington corridor, seeking relief from\ntariffs, including sector specific rates, offering import concessions in return.\nOver the weekend, US Commerce Secretary Lutnick said that US tariff rates might\nbe set this week, but will come into effect on 1 August.  \n\nThree trade deals have been concluded (at the time of writing), with the UK,\nChina and Vietnam. What were the telling parts of these deals?\n\nFirstly, a baseline tariff rate stays, ranging from 10% to 30%. Details on the\nexact concessions and product-wise relaxations are scant, beyond few key talking\npoints.\n\nSecondly, an implicit acknowledgement that partners will buy more from the US\nhas been built in, aimed at reducing the trade gap and addressing few non-trade\nmeasures.\n\nNext, efforts have been made to rein in transshipment flows, likely targeted at\nChina’s move to channel trade through the region to tap the tariff differential\n(for instance, 40% levy on any goods deemed to be transhipped through Vietnam)\nevident in the recent months (see chart). We also note that regional countries\nhave initiated counteraction on their end, for instance India tightening rules\nof origin documentation and Vietnam creating a central agency to issue and\nverify origin documents.\n\nAdd to this, calls to be tolerant of currency appreciation by the region vs the\nUS dollar was presumably also in the mix, even if not explicitly mentioned.\nLastly, assurances of an increase in investments into the US.\n\nWhere to from here? In addition to being a risk mitigation exercise, which way\nthe tariff announcements go will have material impact on markets and economies.\nWe draw up scenarios for Liberation Day 2.0 (changes to take effect in August).\n\n\n\nApril redux (35%) - this scenario assumes that the US administration reinstates\nthe reciprocal tariffs with the rate determined by level of perceived\ncooperation in trade deals by partners. Few of the 10-15 countries with whom\ndiscussions are nearing the final leg might get temporary reprieve. Impact:\nUnless details are readily available, this might sow confusion, and hurt\nconfidence.Summer discount (25%) – Preset reduction of the reciprocal rates (for\ninstance, half) announced back in April, with the baseline minimum rate of 10%.\nWashington may continue to negotiate with countries in the coming weeks, which\nmight could see further finetuning of the bilateral rates. Impact: This will\nkeep markets’ ears close to the ground but not be viewed as an outright\nnegative.Kick the can (probability assigned 20%) – an extension of 30-90 days\nciting the long list of countries that are still in wait to finalise details and\nconcessions for the US (1 Aug kick-in reflects this). Impact: Status quo for\nmarkets and economic outlook.Sector-specific action (15%) – this assumes a\ncontinuation of the current 10% baseline on most of the countries and higher 30%\non China, while focusing more on sector specific moves, which the US might deem\nsensitive, strategic or technologies that can be put to dual-use. Action on\nsemiconductors, electronics, and pharmaceuticals, which were left out of the\ntariff umbrella might be considered. Action on auto, steel and aluminium are\nbound to continue. Impact: Part relief as a sharp increase in tariff rates are\nallayed, but countries with exposure to these specific sectors will be impacted.\nFor instance, Asian countries are key suppliers of semiconductors to the US,\nwith Malaysia leading the pack, followed by Taiwan, Vietnam, and South\nKorea.Reconciliation (5%) – this would be the most optimistic but least probable\nscenario where the US government strikes a conciliatory tone and counts on\nbilateral trade deals to gradually improve its trade balance.\n\n\nAfter a roller coaster ride in wake of the April’s Liberation Day, equities have\nsince recovered, notwithstanding an escalation in Middle east tensions, US\nfiscal concerns, and tariff uncertainty, in the interim. S&P 500 is near a fresh\nhigh, while regional bond/equity markets have attracted diversification inflows.\nMuch of the complacency is evident in options markets, signalling traders are\nnot betting on a significant shake up post Liberation Day 2.0.\n\nAdopting a cautious but non-recessionary stance, DBS US economist has maintained\nthe GDP forecast at 1.5% YoY, along with a 50bp cut from the US Fed in 2H25 and\nanother 50bp cut in 2026. DBS currency strategist maintains that while the USD\nretains its structural advantages, there are early signs of erosion that leads\nto a slow and steady decline in its global dominance. For Asia, these scenarios\n(barring the most optimistic option) are likely to impact regional and trade\noutlook, with some concern already baked into a stronger first half of exports\non frontloading, setting the stage for a weak 2H25.

The increasing odds of earlier-than-expected Fed’s cuts are also\nmotivating investors to look for alternatives in the region. Major currencies\nhave stabilized, paving the way for more aggressive cuts from Asia central\nbanks. Amongst all, China bonds received most of the inflows amid its gigantic\nmarket size. It also serves as an alternative haven asset to its USD\ncounterpart. Hong Kong rates are another key beneficiary, thanks to the HKD peg\nsystem.\n\nChina\n\nChina recorded a notable pickup in capital inflows in May, with non-bank sectors\ncontributing US$33bn—nearly double April’s US$17.3bn. Bond inflows rose sharply,\nclimbing from US$1.5bn to US$5.6bn, likely reflecting a growing skepticism over\nUS Treasuries and a shift toward alternative safe assets.\n\nDespite a widening US-China yield gap, recent inflows point to investors’\nlonger-term focus on diversification. The yuan’s relative stability, especially\ncompared to a weaker US dollar—reinforces China’s appeal amid a broader\nde-dollarization trend. In our view, foreign participation in the Chinese bond\nmarket could trend back toward the 3% share last seen in 2021 from 2.4%\ncurrently.\n\nThese inflows, coupled with May’s easing measures—including a 10bp policy rate\nreduction and a 50bp reserve requirement ratio cut injecting RMB 1 trn—suggest\nthe PBOC can afford to stay on hold in the near term to evaluate policy\ntransmission, particularly with trade tensions easing under the current “tariff\ntruce”. However, subdued domestic activity, elevated real interest rates, heavy\nbond issuance, and large upcoming medium-term lending facility maturities point\nto further easing ahead. We expect an additional 20bp cut in the 1Y LPR and\nanother 50bp RRR reduction in 2H25, helping anchor short-end yields and steepen\nthe CGB curve.\n\nHong Kong\n\nAlong with the appreciation of other Asian currencies, USD/HKD reached the\nstrong side of its 7.75 trading band in May. The Aggregate Balance jumped almost\nfourfold to HKD174bn from HKD44bn. Consequently, 1-month HIBOR plunged from\n4.06% in April to around 0.5% recently. While HIBOR has been rebounding due to\nquarter-end effects and HKMA intervention to buy HKD at the weak side of the\nband, HKD rates will likely remain substantially below their USD counterparts.\nThe Aggregate Balance is expected to remain ample, above HKD 120bn in the near\nterm.\n\nIn our view, the 3M HIBOR-SOFR differential could widen from approximately 50bps\nto approximately 150bps if the terminal Fed Funds Rate reaches 3.50%. Such a\nspread could discourage aggressive arbitrage (the FX risk of 7.75-7.85 is\nroughly 130bps).  3M HIBOR should settle at 2.30% by the end of 2025 after the\ninitial HKMA intervention at the weak side of the trading band.  1M HIBOR will\nalso maintain a much wider spread, around 80bps, against the 3M tenor given the\nample liquidity.\n\nFlush liquidity is translating into demand for HKD bonds, which will soothen the\nupcoming issuance. According to the government budget announced in February,\npublic debt as a percentage of GDP is expected to increase only modestly, from\n9% to 16%.  Tight HKD government bond supply, which has contracted by 37% since\nthe end of COVID, will help contain yields. The Financial Secretary also\nprojected that the city would return to a fiscal surplus after three consecutive\nyears of deficits, further bolstering the case for HKD govvies.\n\nLower HKD rates will also help ease credit risk and support overall credit\ndemand, as banks enjoy cheaper access to wholesale funding. The reversal of\nSHIBOR-HIBOR spreads is also fueling lending to Mainland China.  However,\nstill-weak economic fundamentals could restrain credit demand. Empirically, loan\ndemand lags HK GDP growth by 4 quarters.  The jobless rate is currently rising\namid ongoing business closures. In capital markets, both bond and equity\nissuance should gain traction with lower HIBORs and higher valuations.  The\nnumber of IPOs in the pipeline reached 187 of late. Meanwhile, Hang Seng Index\nis returning to 24,000 levels along with rising M2.\n\n\nTo read the full report, click here to ."}

Over the week, Trump sent letters to 21 countries, including Japan\nand emerging markets, informing them that the US would impose blanket tariffs\nclose to the 2 Apr reciprocal tariffs on their exports to the US, effective 1\nAug. Trump has effectively extended the negotiating window by another three\nweeks, allowing countries to reach limited trade deals on America’s terms with\nconcessionary tariff rates like those offered to Vietnam. He also threatened 50%\ntariffs on Brazilian goods and an additional 10% tariff on any country aligning\nwith the “Anti-American” policies of the BRICS.\n\nCompared to the 90-day tariff pause on 9 Apr, this shorter 24-day extension to 1\nAug does not necessarily ease global trade tensions. These written “take it or\nleave it” letters could be viewed as brinksmanship with compressed timelines,\nhardened positions, and unclear outcomes that reintroduce uncertainty and\nvolatility.

The market consensus expects next\nweek’s CPI inflation to rise to 2.7% y/y (0.3% m/m) in June from 2.4% y/y (0.1%\nm/m) in May. Core inflation is also expected to increase to 3% y/y (0.3% m/m)\nfrom 2.8% y/y (0.1% m/m).\n\nAccording to the minutes, Fed cuts are possible later in the year if the impact\nof tariffs on inflation proves temporary, as indicated by the steady readings in\nthe New York Fed’s inflation expectations across the 1Y, 3Y, and 5Y horizons.\nThe future market is keeping the door open for a 25 bps cut in September.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: New York Fed’s median inflation expectations\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Bank of New York, DBS\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the PDF to read the full report which includes insights on ASEAN &\nIndia, Singapore, and Malaysia."}

US nonfarm payroll came in at 147k in June, surpassing both May’s upwardly\nrevised figure of 144k and market expectations of 106k. Unemployment rate\ndeclined to 4.1% in June from 4.2% in May, defying consensus forecast that\nanticipated a rise to 4.3%. We believe the stronger-than-expected labour report\nhas diminished the likelihood of the Fed’s earlier rate cut.\n\nDuring the European Central Bank’s annual forum in Sintra, Portugal on 1 Jul,\nFed Chair Jerome Powell appeared to have softened his stance about an earlier\nJuly cut. However, Powell has maintained the view that US inflation would be\nhigher in the coming months because of tariffs. Hence, the CPI data on 15 Jul\nwill also be important. According to median expectations, headline and core\ninflation are expected to increase to 0.3% m/m in June from 0.1% in May. Before\nthat, the New York Fed’s inflation expectation gauges, due on 8 Jul, will be key\nin reassuring that the inflationary impact of the tariffs will be one-off.\n\nGiven the US-Vietnam trade deal on 2 Jul and the looming 9 Jul deadline for the\nreciprocal tariff pause, markets are also alert to similar trade announcements\nwith India and the European Union.

The\nlegislation extends Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and delivers new tax breaks that he\npromised during his 2024 presidential campaign (e.g. boosting military spending\nand funding a mass migrant deportation drive). It also cuts health and food\nsafety net programs and reverses much of Biden’s green energy incentives.

Powell reiterated that\nthe Fed’s stance was a pause, not a pivot. Despite tame long-term inflation\nexpectations, he expected the tariffs to pass through in the June and July\ninflation numbers. In doing so, he kept the door open for a September cut on the\ncondition that the one-off price increase did not present an “ongoing inflation\nproblem.” He also wanted to know where the tariff rates would settle after the\n90-day pauses end in July. Fed speakers—Governor Michael Barr, Fed Presidents\nRaphael Bostic (Atlanta), and Neel Kashkari (Minneapolis)—also backed Powell’s\ncall for caution on tariffs and patience on rate cuts. The Conference Board\nnoted that tariffs remained on top of consumers’ minds and were frequently\nassociated with concerns about their negative economic and price impacts.\n\nHowever, Powell added that the Fed could cut sooner if the US jobs markets\nweaken more than expected. We noted that US nonfarm payrolls dropped below 100k\nin Jun-Aug 2024 when the Fed delivered its first and larger-than-expected 50 bps\ncut last September. Payrolls have been higher at 147k and 139k in Apr and May\n2025 despite the rise in the four-week initial jobless claims. Nonetheless,\nconsensus expects next week’s US monthly jobs data to show payrolls declining\nagain to 116k in June and the unemployment rate rising to 4.3% from 4.2%.\n\nUS Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Index declined to 93.0 in June from\n98.4 in May which was clearly below consensus of 99.8. Expectations Index\ndropped by 4.6 points to 69 in June with more pessimistic views on business\nconditions, job availability, and future income prospects amid tariffs\nuncertainty, immigration measures, and public sector employee firing. The\nsurvey's so-called labour market differential, derived from data on respondents'\nviews on whether jobs are plentiful or hard to get, narrowed to a four-year low\nof 11.1 in June from 12.7 in May.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump stated that he has three or four people in mind to succeed Fed\nChair Powell next year, adding on to his pressure on the Fed to cut rates. If\nTrump puts out his Fed Chair nominees early, this could undercut Powell’s\ncredibility in steering policy before the official end of his term in May 2026.\nIt could lead to the pricing of more dovish Fed policy settings.\n\nAfter Trump’s unexpected strikes at Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend,\nTrump announced that Isreal and Iran have agreed to a tentative phased ceasefire\nto end what he called “The 12-Day War”.

Recent\nhigh-profile failures, including the Iberian Peninsula blackout and Heathrow\nshutdown, exposed vulnerabilities in aging grid infrastructure. Although clean\nenergy sources accounted for only 32% of global energy in 2024, key sources –\nparticularly wind, solar, and nuclear energy – continue to gain momentum, driven\nby rising environmental awareness, policy support, and surging AI-related power\ndemand.

This week, we highlight quantum\ncomputing, which could be humanity’s next “fire moment,” unpack the implications\nof the Reconciliation Bill for the healthcare sector and examine bubbles and the\nnext Fed regime.\n\n \n\nQuantum computing may be humanity’s next “fire moment,” says Haim Israel, Head\nof Global Thematic Research.\n\nA quantum computer (QC) can perform in one second what would take a human ~50\nquintillion years. Experts believe we could reach quantum advantage by 2030,\nwhen QCs can solve useful real-world problems faster than a classical computer.\nThe combination of quantum and AI, encryption, and government-backed innovation\ncould unlock up to $2 trillion in economic value by 2035. A QC with just 10\nqubits can outperform classical computing systems 100-fold, and AI applications\nare a natural fit since quantum solves the memory and compute scaling\nbottlenecks slowing today’s largest generative models. QCs also consume far less\npower—the equivalent of a fridge vs. a small city for supercomputers. The\nbiggest hurdle remains error rates—even record-low levels are still 150bn times\nhigher than classical systems.\n\n \n\nPresident Trump’s Reconciliation Bill spells trouble for the healthcare sector,\nparticularly for hospitals and Medicaid/Exchange-focused managed care\norganizations (MCOs), according to Kevin Fischbeck, Health Care Facilities and\nManaged Care Analyst.\n\nThe bill could strip coverage from ~15 million people over the next five years,\ndriving a 2% volume headwind and increasing bad debt as more patients are unable\nto pay for care. The sector is transitioning from Biden-era 2-3% tailwinds to\nstructural headwinds and this is a shift the market may not fully appreciate.\n\n \n\nChief Investment Strategist Michael Hartnett believes that Wall Street is front\nrunning Fed capitulation and the potential for a nominal GDP (gross domestic\nproduct) boom.\n\nThe easiest way to pay for the One Big Beautiful Bill could be One Big Beautiful\nBubble. Strength in semis, megacap tech and banks provide some evidence of\nbubble behavior but the biggest tell would be stocks ignoring a rise in\ninflation expectations and higher bond yields. The BofA Fund Managers Survey\nequity overweight is not yet worrisome and Michael points out that greed is\nalways harder to reverse than fear.\n\nShould I stay or should I go\n\nWithout entering into the legal intricacies of whether President Trump can\nremove Chairman Powell or not, there is a clear focus on the Fed and, from\nTrump's perspective, the need to cut interest rates to reduce the government's\ninterest bill, which is running well above 3pp (percentage points) of GDP (Gross\nDomestic Product). But cutting rates to help finance the government deficit is\nwe think probably one of the worst reasons to cut rates unless we are dealing\nwith an extreme case of fiscal dominance and would show a clear deterioration in\nFed independence.\n\n \n\nOne more reason not to cut\n\nA natural corollary is that doing that might backfire and end up bear steepening\nthe yield curve in a way that ends up increasing rather than decreasing the\nmarginal cost of issuing government debt, while de-anchoring inflation\nexpectations, weakening the dollar, and increasing credit risk. In this\nscenario, this unnecessary politically driven noise raises the bar for cuts,\nsince now the Fed needs to have a very clear case for cutting rates without\nbeing perceived as capitulating to political interference.\n\n \n\nData review: rising goods inflation, resilient spending\n\nThe CPI (Consumer Price Index) data showed more evidence of tariff driven price\nhikes, but core CPI still came in below expectations at 0.2% month over month\n(m/m). PPI data was soft across the board, with both headline and core\nunchanged. Given the CPI and PPI (Producer Price Index) data for June, we are\ntracking a 0.3% m/m increase for core PCE (personal consumption expenditure)\ninflation. PCE inflation could hit 3.0% as soon as July. In turn, retail sales\ncame in stronger than expected (but below our forecast) with the control group\nand ex-autos at 0.5% m/m. The control group was revised down but this was offset\nby upward revision to food services, which also grew by 0.6% in June."}

Portfolios are subject to\nmarket risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned\nby the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may\ntherefore be less than what you paid for them.  Market values can change daily\ndue to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises,\nterrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries,\ncompanies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and\npotential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events.  Accordingly,\nyou can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this\nstrategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Active Management: in\npursuing the Portfolio’s investment objective, the Adviser has considerable\nleeway in deciding which investments to buy, hold or sell on a day-to-day basis,\nand which trading strategies to use. The success or failure of such decisions\nwill affect performance. There is the risk that the Adviser’s asset allocation\nmethodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect\nin light of actual market conditions and the Portfolio may not achieve its\ninvestment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a\nsignificant possibility of loss. The portfolio’s investments in commodity-linked\nnotes involve substantial risks, including risk of loss of a significant portion\nof their principal value. In addition to commodity risk, they may be subject to\nadditional special risks, such as risk of loss of interest and principal, lack\nof secondary market and risk of greater volatility, that do not affect\ntraditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase\ninvestment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed-income securities are\nsubject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest\npayments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the\ncreditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a\nrising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods\nof volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate\nenvironment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may\nbe more sensitive to interest rate changes. Equity and foreign securities are\ngenerally more volatile than fixed income securities and are subject to\ncurrency, political, economic and market risks. Equity values fluctuate in\nresponse to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small-capitalization\ncompanies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and\nfinancial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger,\nmore established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries\nare greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets.\nExchange traded funds (ETFs) shares have many of the same risks as direct\ninvestments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as\nthe value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds\nETFs and other Investment Funds, the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and\nthose of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs\nand Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities.\nDerivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses\nand may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio’s performance.\nA currency forward is a hedging tool that does not involve any upfront payment.\nThe use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio.\n\nIMPORTANT DISCLOSURES:\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

Portfolios are subject to\nmarket risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned\nby the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may\ntherefore be less than what you paid for them.  Market values can change daily\ndue to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises,\nterrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries,\ncompanies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and\npotential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events.  Accordingly,\nyou can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this\nstrategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Active Management: in\npursuing the Portfolio’s investment objective, the Adviser has considerable\nleeway in deciding which investments to buy, hold or sell on a day-to-day basis,\nand which trading strategies to use. The success or failure of such decisions\nwill affect performance. There is the risk that the Adviser’s asset allocation\nmethodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect\nin light of actual market conditions and the Portfolio may not achieve its\ninvestment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a\nsignificant possibility of loss. The portfolio’s investments in commodity-linked\nnotes involve substantial risks, including risk of loss of a significant portion\nof their principal value. In addition to commodity risk, they may be subject to\nadditional special risks, such as risk of loss of interest and principal, lack\nof secondary market and risk of greater volatility, that do not affect\ntraditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase\ninvestment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed-income securities are\nsubject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest\npayments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the\ncreditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a\nrising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods\nof volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate\nenvironment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may\nbe more sensitive to interest rate changes. Equity and foreign securities are\ngenerally more volatile than fixed income securities and are subject to\ncurrency, political, economic and market risks. Equity values fluctuate in\nresponse to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small-capitalization\ncompanies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and\nfinancial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger,\nmore established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries\nare greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets.\nExchange traded funds (ETFs) shares have many of the same risks as direct\ninvestments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as\nthe value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds\nETFs and other Investment Funds, the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and\nthose of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs\nand Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities.\nDerivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses\nand may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio’s performance.\nA currency forward is a hedging tool that does not involve any upfront payment.\nThe use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio.\n\nIMPORTANT DISCLOSURES:\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results. The returns referred to in\nthe audio are those of representative indices and are not meant to depict the\nperformance of a specific investment.\n\nThere is no guarantee that any investment strategy will work under all market\nconditions, and each investor should evaluate their ability to invest for the\nlong-term, especially during periods of downturn in the market.\n\nA separately managed account may not be appropriate for all investors. Separate\naccounts managed according to the particular Strategy may include securities\nthat may not necessarily track the performance of a particular index. Please\nconsider the investment objectives, risks and fees of the Strategy carefully\nbefore investing. A minimum asset level is required.\n\nFor important information about the investment managers, please refer to Form\nADV Part 2.\n\nThe views and opinions and/or analysis expressed are those of the author or the\ninvestment team as of the date of preparation of this material and are subject\nto change at any time without notice due to market or economic conditions and\nmay not necessarily come to pass.

Welcome to a new episode of our CIO Zooming In series, where we discuss burning market and investor questions. Today's topic of\ndiscussion is private credit, a fast growing segment of private markets. To understand how investors should navigate the challenges and opportunities\nof investing in private credit, today I'm joined by Mathieu Forcioli, our Global Head of Alternatives. Mathieu, welcome and thanks for joining us today.\nSo Mathieu, for the benefit of our viewers who are very new to this asset class, please can you explain what exactly is private credit?\nMathieu\nWell, Neha, in theory, private credit covers any loan negotiated privately between two parties. Now these days, when investors talk about private credit,\nit's most often they're actually referring to a specific part of private credit, which we call direct lending. What is direct lending? Direct lending is\neffectively providing a loan to a corporate, often backed by a private equity manager who's doing a leveraged buyout of that company. Now historically\nthose loans were provided by banks, and when the loan was large enough, the banks would sell and syndicate that loan into the market to public\ninvestors. And that's what gave rise to what we call broadly syndicated loan, which is today a very large part of the fixed income asset class. But the\ncorporate might be too small to be able to access that market, might want specific terms that are not suitable for public markets or might want to keep\nits loan private. And that's what we would call direct lending. Now, banks historically would provide these kind of loans, but regulators have\nencouraged them to step out of these loans because of the risks that they carry. And that's when direct lenders have stepped in. Those direct lenders\nare asset managers that are managing money for their clients and trying to get the best returns by providing direct loans to companies.\nNeha\nSo Mathieu, why should a typical investor holding a 60/40 portfolio consider having an allocation to private credit, especially when they already have a\nbig chunk of their portfolio allocated to public fixed income markets, which theoretically should provide them with downside protection in times of\nmarket stress.\nMathieu\nPrivate credit and direct lending tends to show greater returns and lower volatility in a portfolio. And that's the main reason why investors have been\nallocating to the asset class. Now there's no free lunch. And why do investors benefit from these better attributes. It's because they are taking illiquidity\nrisk. That's the most important part that our listeners should understand. So, investors that have a long term investment horizon and can bear that\nilliquidity risk do allocate to the asset class, in particular, pension funds, insurance companies, including HSBC’s own insurance companies. And we see\nmore and more of our clients, those who can take that illiquidity risk and are eligible to buy such private credit funds, we do see those investors starting\nto allocate to the asset class for the benefits that they bring.\nNeha\nThanks, Mathieu. I think this is a great reminder that if one is investing for the long run and is able to withstand some illiquidity, then their portfolio\nshould benefit from higher returns and potentially lower volatility if there were to have an allocation to private credit. At this point, I'd also like to show\nour viewers a chart which shows that historically, private credit has had the lowest of drawdowns and the fastest of recovery times in comparison to all\nother asset classes which are shown in this chart. Mathieu, let us now discuss a key challenge that's facing private credit. Recently, the IMF warned\nthat nearly half of the corporates that are borrowing through these direct lenders are actually operating on negative free cash flows, which effectively is\nkeeping them hooked on to the so-called ”payment-in-kind” notes, wherein they put off their interest payments until a later date, but often at punishing\nrates. Do you think fundamentals are deteriorating in direct lending?\nMathieu\nWell, as usual Neha, the devil is in the details, right? First thing I really want to remind our listeners today is that in direct lending and in private credit in\ngeneral, there's no upside, and only downside. What do I mean by that? The most you can get back is effectively the principle of the loan that you've\nlent out and the coupons that you've negotiated and that the borrower is paying, But your downside risk is that you can lose all of your money. So it's\nvery important that you select managers that can manage effectively that downside risk. Now, when it comes to your specific question on ”payment-in-\nkind” or PIK, as we call it, broadly speaking, I would say that there's two kinds of PIK. The ones that have being negotiated at the beginning of the loan\nbetween the borrower and the lender, because, it was expected to provide the best outcome for both the lender and the borrower, because of certain\ncharacteristics of the company. The second kind of PIK structures are those that are negotiated during the life of a loan because suddenly the borrower\n\nPUBLIC\nPUBLIC\ncannot pay its coupons anymore. And obviously, these second kind of PIK structures are those that deserve a little bit more attention, because they are\na sign that the borrower might have some difficulties paying back. What I would say overall is that today the environment is still relatively healthy for\ndirect lending and private credit. But of course, the asset class may suffer and may go through a credit cycle, if the economy and the economic\nsituation deteriorates, like other asset classes. Our job is to make sure that eventually our investors in the asset class will keep on benefiting from an\noutperformance versus the more traditional liquid credit asset classes, when they invest into direct lending.\nNeha\nMathieu, data show that direct lending has started to rise again, especially in the US. But geographically, as we seek regional and geographical\ndiversification, where else do you see opportunities emerging other than the US? Are you seeing any interesting opportunities in, for example, in Europe\nor in Asia?\nMathieu\nUS is the most developed market when it comes to direct lending, but also the most competitive market. And we’re starting to see overlap in the\nportfolios of the different managers that we work with. About 10 to 20% of one manager’s portfolio would overlap with another manager's portfolio of\nloans, right. And then a region that is quite interesting to look at is actually Europe. It's a very fragmented market. As a direct lender, you need local\npresence in each of the countries that you operate. And that provides a very interesting opportunity for investors and diversification. So I would\ndefinitely put Europe on the map for investors. Asia is still in the early days, the market is still mostly dominated by banks. But it's clear that they would\nprobably at some point follow a similar path to what we're seeing in the US and in Europe.\nNeha\nSo to conclude, private credit, by the virtue of being private has a very different risk return profile versus its public market counterpart. Secondly,\ninvestors who are investing for the long run in a typical 60/40 portfolio and who are willing to withstand some illiquidity, should benefit from having an\nallocation to private credit especially as it helps in bringing higher returns and lower volatility over the long run. But the downside risk of investing in\nprivate credit is that one may lose their entire capital. Therefore, investing in the right type of private credit managers is very essential. And lastly, whilst\nthe US remains the most active market in private credit, there are some green shoots of opportunities emerging in Europe and as Asia, develops there\nwill be some very interesting private credit opportunities to be tapped in Asia as well. Thank you, Mathieu, for sharing your razor sharp insights on\nprivate credit with us today."}

Investors everywhere\nbreathe a sigh of relief and markets have retraced most of the moves that we saw over the past two weeks\nNow we make three observations about the market reaction during the conflict.\nFirstly, while oil prices of course have spiked significantly, the hit to risk appetite for other asset classes was\nrelatively mild, as investors were already cautious and dealing with a wall of worries.\nSecondly, diversification worked. Bonds and gold benefited from safe haven flows while equities fell, and\ncorrelations turned sharply negative. Even the US dollar saw some upside, illustrating that in spite of the\ndeficit concerns and questions about US exceptionalism ending, the US dollar and US Treasuries still remain\nessential in times of stress.\nAnd lastly, geopolitical events are near impossible to forecast. Most specialists were surprised by at least\none or two of the twists and turns in the conflict. So, given that geopolitics and policymaking remain erratic,\nit’s essential to build resilient portfolios.\nSo we continue to do this through our multi-asset diversification, an active approach to investing and a\nfocus on quality assets. Long-term thematics also help, as illustrated by the relative resilience in technology\nand AI related stocks during the conflict.\nNow, what lies ahead?\nIf the ceasefire holds, we think that the market’s attention will turn back to mostly familiar topics. The\nimminent US earnings season is key, because CEOs can give us more up-to-date information about what’s\ngoing on than the backward looking economic data do.\nNow, analysts expect a mild contraction in earnings this quarter, so the bar is low, and we think companies\nwill exceed it. Keep in mind that USD weakness should also boost earnings. Concerns about the debt pile\nmay come back, but Treasury yields are now well below the ‘danger zone’ of near 4.7% where US Treasury\nyields tend to cause issues for equities. Inflation has also been somewhat below expectations, so we think\nthat the market is right to continue to expect two rate cuts this year, which is of course supportive for\nmarkets.\nAnd lastly, in China, retail sales growth continues to tick up and now stands at 6.4%, thanks to government\nstimulus and money supply growth. Investors are optimistic about Chinese tech, and if consumption can\ncontinue to gradually improve, that is, of course, another positive for Chinese stocks.\nSo in summary, we are encouraged by the relative resilience in markets during the conflict. And coupled\nwith low consensus expectations, weak investor sentiment and positioning, and relatively healthy data, we\nthink that there are good reasons to continue to move into well-diversified portfolios.\nHSBC Investment Outlook – July 2025 Monthly View\nWillem Sels"}

As that period has now ended andseveral countries have received letters with new tariff levels, we held awebinar to assess the situation and examine the market implications. Our view isthat tariffs will remain more elevated and volatile than before, as they are apolicy tool to achieve many objectives. In spite of the economic headwindsresulting from the tariffs, we think global economic and earnings growth willremain positive, with many pockets of interesting opportunities. As a result, weremain invested but focused on quality, diversification and active management,to balance volatility management with the discovery of opportunities. * The panel suggested that the US-China trade relationship has seen a tentative stabilisation and could now see gradual step-by-step progress. That said, our strategy is to remain selective, focusing on technology-led innovation and high dividend payers, with some additional opportunities in select consumer goods thanks to trade-in programmes * The EU is hoping that not receiving a letter with a trade tariff is a good sign, but it is unclear where the tariff will eventually end up. Sectoral tariffs – for example on pharmaceuticals – are a key variable as well. The outperformance of European stocks compared to global benchmarks already faded in April and we hold a neutral view, preferring the US instead * The US faces headwinds from the inflationary impact of the tariffs, but we still expect two Fed rate cuts this year. Bond markets also offer attractive real rates and term premia to compensate investors for uncertainty. Tech stocks may continue to lead as IT is seen as a strategic sector where the US wants to continue to lead. Industrials and communication benefit from this strength in tech, as well as the US objective to re-onshore production * As for USD, we expect only mild further weakness. The US policy is more interested in maintaining the reserve status than in weakening the USD to gain competitiveness"}

Around a dozen other countries, including Malaysia,Kazakhstan, South Africa, and Myanmar, are also facing new tariffs ranging from25 per cent to 40 per cent. The market reaction is mixed as the higher rates area negative, but the extended negotiating time is a plus. * President Trump also warned that any country aligning with BRICS policies seen as “anti-American” or supporting de-dollarization could face an extra 10 per cent tariff. He made clear that retaliation by other countries would trigger even higher tariffs. The EU is trying to rush to a framework agreement this week in an attempt to lock in the 10 per cent rate ahead of 1 August * Negotiations Still Possible: Treasury Secretary Bessent described the new tariff letters as open invitations to negotiate, not ultimatums. He noted a surge in last-minute trade offers and emphasised that countries can avoid tariffs by moving production to the US * The global market reaction is mixed. US stocks fell around -1 per cent but the possibility for negotiations is putting some Asian markets in the green today. The JPY weakened but KRW retraced its initial weakness, and shares of Japanese automakers have been volatile. The announcements come as investors are already watching rising US debt levels and higher long-term borrowing costs, so there is some mild pressure on bonds, though Fed rate cut expectations have not materially moved on the news * The new tariffs could raise the risk of upward pressure on inflation while weighing on corporate profit margins. That said, much of the hit to 2025 US earnings expectations has already been priced in, with very conservative earnings growth assumptions for Q2.

In our view, there have been a number of factorswhich has supported the rally, including the capital inflows that led to a sharpdrop in the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rates (HIBOR) since early May, a pick-upin Hong Kong IPO activity, signs of recovery in mainland Chinese economy, aswell as consistent southbound inflows via the Stock Connect. However, we notethat there are lingering challenges for Hong Kong’s economic outlook. We stayneutral in Hong Kong equities. * Historically, as compared to other Asian markets, Hong Kong equities, with interest rate-sensitive sectors such as financials and real estate being a large part of the universe, are in general more sensitive to interest rate movements. The fall in HIBOR since May and the expected Fed rate cuts in the coming months should be supportive for Hong Kong equities * The liquidity in the banking system, as evident by the low levels of HIBOR, could be switched into equities if the investor sentiment continues to improve. The low levels of HIBOR could also have incremental positive implications for Hong Kong residential property if positive cost of carry (rental yield net of effective mortgage rates) resumes * While the investor sentiment for Hong Kong has turned somewhat more favourable, retail sales remain under much pressure on changes in consumption patterns of both Hong Kong residents and mainland China tourists. We are also cautious on Hong Kong’s growth outlook for the coming quarters as global tariff and trade uncertainties will likely put more pressure on external demand, considering trade accounts for about 20 per cent of Hong Kong’s GDP * Currently at 12-month consensus forward P/E ratio of 13.5x, Hong Kong domestic stocks remain inexpensive relative to global equities. We retain a neutral position as we look for more evidence of a sustainable improvement in the fundamental outlook of the Hong Kong economy, the budget deficits and corporate earnings. We see tactical opportunities among undervalued sectors and stocks signalling growth recovery and offering stable cash returns.

How can investors prepare portfolios to for such cyclical and\nstructural changes to capture opportunities and avoid the risks?\n\nJean Chia\nGlobal Cheif Investment Officer,\nBank of Singapore\n\nWhat happens when the global order undergoes seismic changes and the outcomes\nahead are uncertain?\n\nHow can investors prepare portfolios to withstand such cyclical and structural\nchanges in order to capture the opportunities and avoid the risks in the next\nchapter?\n\nSince President Donald Trump’s inauguration this year, global businesses and\nmarkets have been buffeted with uncertainty, grappling with the potential impact\nof tariff policies, US fiscal sustainability and the Israel-Iran conflict on\ninflation, growth and overall investment performance. The Trump administration\nhas catalysed the start of a global shift away from the US-led order of free\nmarkets, free trade and globalisation.\n\nOver the next five years, these five key Supertrends covering geopolitics,\nmacroeconomics, asset allocation, technology, environment and demographics, will\nguide investors and businesses:\n\nThese long-term insights were derived from the collective insights of Bank of\nSingapore’s Chief Investment Office (CIO) and Global Advisory Council (CIO GAC).\nSince 2024, this group of thought leaders from think tanks and investment firms\nworldwide have augmented CIO investment insights for wealth management clients\nin building long-term portfolios, for every generation.\n\nChanging World Order: Borders and Barriers\n\nThe new world order of geopolitical rivalry, rising trade barriers, hostility to\nimmigration and widening populism is rapidly replacing the US-led order of free\nmarkets, free trade and globalisation that prevailed since the end of the Cold\nWar.\n\nThis emerging new order may keep evolving for the rest of the decade, as\ncoalitions come together on common interests (e.g. Europe and China on climate\nchange, free trade) while opposing on other issues (US, Europe, Japan and India\nversus China on Indo-Pacific security).\n\nThis shift from a US-led order to a more fragmented world, will result in\npersistent inflation, higher interest rates, a weaker USD, record gold prices\nand stronger demand for safe haven assets over the next five to 10 years.\n\nRobust Asset Allocation\n\nMarkets are inherently uncertain, and conditions shift quickly and unexpectedly.\nToday’s environment of economic regime shifts, policy instability, and\nincreasingly correlated risks indicate that asset allocation under a period of\nuncertainty will demand greater discipline.\n\nA robust asset allocation is not a specific weighting or expression within the\nportfolio – it is the architecture that governs the portfolio’s construction. By\nexplicitly acknowledging that market inputs are uncertain – returns,\nvolatilities, correlations – robust optimisation enables portfolios to hold up\nnot just in the expected scenario, but across a wide range of outcomes. This\nshift from precise prediction to resilience by design is central to investing in\nan uncertain world.\n\nThis approach to portfolio construction complements our long-held view of the\ndiversification benefits of alternatives and gold amidst the shifting regimes in\nglobal markets. This translates into more resilient portfolios, better downside\nprotection, and more reliable alignment with investor goals.\n\nThe Intelligence Economy – AI\n\nCompanies across major markets are ramping up their AI-related investments, with\nthe bulk of the expenditure largely aimed at transforming critical business\nfunctions, developing new products and services, and enhancing individual\nproductivity.\n\nAgentic AI will be the next frontier in the application of this technology,\nwhere models will go beyond question-and-answer large language models (LLM)\ncapabilities to executing real world tasks. This will lead to a broadening of AI\nbeneficiaries beyond semiconductors/cloud-service providers to a longer-tail of\nplayers across industries.\n\nWe see the proliferation of AI use cases across sectors using inherently rich\ndatasets such as financial services, healthcare as well as\nmanufacturing/logistics. AI applications are increasingly centred around\npredictive analytics, monitoring and detection, as well as advanced pattern\nrecognition.\n\nSearch for Security\n\nFundamental enablers of modern life, such as energy, food and digital networks,\nwill need to be actively secured amid shifts in climate, geopolitics and\ntechnology.\n\nWith higher frequency of extreme weather events due to global warming, climate\nadaptation investments of USD215-387b annually by 2030 will be required for\ndeveloping countries alone.\n\nWith military conflicts in Russia-Ukraine and the Middle East conflict, elevated\ngeopolitical tensions and America’s retreat form multi-lateral alliances, there\nis added urgency for nations to increase military spending, ensure supply chain\nresilience and cybersecurity.\n\nLiving 2.0 – People and Places\n\nThe twin demographic dilemma of a shrinking labour pool tasked with supporting a\ngrowing senior population is becoming a global phenomenon.\n\nMacro impact of an ageing population includes downward pressure on inflation,\ngrowth and fiscal balances, with ambiguous net effect on interest rates.\n\nSolutions and opportunities to address a shrinking workforce include an\nappropriate human capital strategy, robotics and AI. Shifts in consumption\npatterns will present tailwinds for Healthcare, Nutrition, Travel & Leisure and\nWealth Management including Insurance.\n\nWith global warming, climate migration may intensify, but it is still unclear\nhow such cross-border movements will impact demographics."}
{"article_title": "Stagflation risk", "publish_date": "2025-07-01", "url": "https://www.ocbc.com//premier-banking/market-insights/global-outlook", "source": "OCBC", "content": "This year, we expect the US will suffer stagflation from the supply shock of\nhigher tariffs on imports. For the rest of the world, growth will be less\naffected but still subdued from the demand pressures of lower exports to the US.\n\nEli Lee\nManaging Director,\nChief Investment Strategist,\nChief Investment Office,\nBank of Singapore Limited\n\nFinancial markets are set to remain volatile in the second half of the year.\n\nThe shocks of the first half of 2025 – sweeping US import tariffs, Europe’s\ndrive to re-arm against Russian threats, the Middle East’s violent wars in Gaza,\nLebanon, Israel and Iran, and Asia’s deteriorating trade outlook - are unlikely\nto be the last for the year.\n\nThis year, we expect that the US will suffer stagflation. The Trump\nadministration’s steep tariffs are a supply shock for the US economy. We expect\nUS core inflation, excluding food and energy, to peak above 3% in 2025.\n\nFor the rest of the world, growth will be less affected but still subdued from\nthe demand shock of lower exports to the US.\n\nIn Europe, higher US tariffs are likely to keep GDP growth in 2025 sluggish and\nbelow 1.0% for the third consecutive year. We expect the European Central Bank\n(ECB) will lower interest rates modestly further. But with European countries\nbeginning to sharply increase defence spending, the ECB may not cut rates much\nbelow 2.00% now.\n\nIn Asia, US tariffs are set to curb the region’s exports. We expect China’s GDP\ngrowth to slow from a solid 5.0% last year towards 4.0% this year. To support\ngrowth, Asian governments are set to run larger budget deficits.\n\nWe expect further US Dollar weakness; volatile US Treasury yields and strong\ndemand for safe haven assets including gold during the second half of 2025.\n\nUS – The Fed is splitting on interest rates\n\nIn the first half of the year, the Federal Reserve (Fed) has kept interest rates\nunchanged at 4.25-4.50% as it waits for more clarity on whether the Trump\nadministration’s sweeping tariff hikes will cause inflation to rise well above\nits 2% target this year.\n\nIn his latest testimony to Congress, Chairman Jerome Powell repeated his view\nfrom June’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting that the Fed would keep\nleaving interest rates unchanged.\n\nThe Fed Chair observed that the US economy remains solid: “despite elevated\nuncertainty, the economy is in a solid position. The unemployment rate remains\nlow, and the labour market is at or near maximum employment. Inflation has come\ndown a great deal but has been running somewhat above our 2% longer-run\nobjective.”\n\nPowell warned that tariffs may raise inflation: “increases in tariffs this year\nare likely to push up prices and weigh on economic activity.”\n\nLast, Powell said officials can wait-and-see: “for the time being, we are well\npositioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before\nconsidering any adjustments to our policy stance.”\n\nIn contrast, President Donald Trump continues to sharply criticise the Fed for\nnot cutting interest rates.\n\nMoreover, previously hawkish Fed Governors Christopher Waller and Michelle\nBowman are also calling for the Fed to ease now as tariffs have had little\nimpact on inflation so far. Both officials are candidates to replace Powell as\nFed Chair in May 2026. Their call for early rate cuts will be welcomed by\nPresident Trump but may appear a political move by other Fed officials.\n\nWe think the majority of the FOMC will vote to continue leaving the fed funds\nrate on hold unless the US labour market deteriorates over the summer. We thus\nkeep our view the Fed will cut interest rates only once this year, leaving the\nfed funds rate above 4.00% still as core inflation is set to peak at over 3% in\n2025 rather than fall towards the Fed’s 2% target. We also stay cautious on\nlong-term US Treasuries given the risk that inflation will force the Fed to keep\ninterest rates higher for longer during the second half of the year.\n\nChina – Growth is resilient but weak links remain\n\nIn the first half of 2025, China’s growth has been resilient despite the shock\nfrom the US trade war.\n\nThe National People’s Congress (NPC) in March agreed to increase the central\ngovernment’s budget deficit target for 2025 from 3% to 4% of GDP, a rare move,\nto help fund more infrastructure spending. Subsidies for consumption have\nboosted retail sales growth to 6.4% year-on-year (YoY). And, in May, the\nPeople’s Bank of China (PBOC) announced its first interest rate cut since\nSeptember, lowering its 7-day reverse repo rate 10bps to 1.40%.\n\nBut China’s weak link remains trade. China’s export growth has fallen from last\nyear’s double-digit increases.\n\nAt the same time, overall demand in the economy remains subdued. Consumption may\nslow as subsidies finish. Property investment continues to contract by more than\n10% YoY and demand for credit remains lacklustre, rising by less than 9% YoY.\n\nWe thus keep our forecast for GDP growth to slow from last year’s solid 5.0%\npace to 4.2% in 2025. The economy is withstanding US trade war, but faster\ngrowth will require more stimulus in the second half of the year.\n\nEurope – Fiscal stimulus will cushion growth\n\nSo far this year, the Eurozone and the UK have withstood the impact of steep US\ntariff hikes. Though growth is likely to be sluggish for 2025 - around 1% of\nGDP, we expect both major economies will avoid a recession. Moreover, Europe’s\noutlook is improving with its growth set to pick up in 2026 as our GDP forecast\ntable shows.\n\nFirst, the ECB has been cutting interest rates consistently since last year from\n4.00% to 2.00% as inflation has returned to its 2% target. We expect one last\ncut to 1.75% this year.\n\nThe Bank of England (BOE) has been reducing interest rates more gradually by 25\nbasis points (bps) each quarter over the past year from 5.25% to 4.25% given\nhigher inflation in the UK but may accelerate its rate cuts to 3.75% or lower as\nBritain’s labour market slows.\n\nSecond, fiscal policy is set to loosen significantly after NATO countries agreed\nto spend 3.5% of GDP a year on core defence requirements, up from 2.0%\ncurrently. The new target will take 5-10 years to be fully reached but Germany\nhas already begun to raise its budget deficit sharply to more than 3% of GDP\nfrom this year onwards.\n\nThus, looser monetary policy and stronger fiscal stimulus are likely to cushion\ngrowth this year and accelerate activity in 2026.\n\nJapan – Outlook clouded by trade war risks\n\nUS trade threats are clouding the outlook, hurting the JPY and making the Bank\nof Japan (BoJ) hesitant to raise interest rates. We expect Washington and Tokyo\nto reach a deal but Japan’s GDP growth is likely to be just 0.6% this year given\nthe uncertainty. Once a deal is reached, we expect the BoJ will resume its\ngradual rate hikes, lifting its overnight rate from 0.50% to 0.75% by the end of\n2025 and helping the JPY rebound from its current lows of 145 against the USD."}

We maintain Overweight positions in Asia ex-Japan and Europe\nequities despite their outperformance.\n\nEli Lee\nManaging Director,\nChief Investment Strategist,\nChief Investment Office,\nBank of Singapore Limited\n\nAfter some turbulence following “Liberation Day” tariff announcements, equity\nmarkets have seen a V-shaped rebound with Asia ex-Japan and European equities\noutperforming the rest. We continue to see 2025 as a year of decent earnings\ngrowth across global markets but keep a watchful eye on tail risks such as\nworse-than-expected geopolitical developments resulting in elevated energy\nprices and inflation, as well as slower-than-expected growth amidst trade\nuncertainties.\n\nWe maintain our Overweight positions in Europe and Asia ex-Japan equities. The\npeaking in trade uncertainty between the US and China is a positive for\nequities, as is a renewed focus by China on supporting the private economy, with\nthe potential for more stimulus. The direction of the US Dollar (USD) is also a\nnoteworthy factor for relative performance of non-US equities, and we continue\nto expect USD weakness ahead. Europe remains attractive over the longer term\ngiven its supportive fiscal and monetary backdrop and undemanding valuations,\nwhile our favoured regions in Asia ex-Japan (Hong Kong/China, Singapore and the\nPhilippines) offer a good mix of growth, healthy fundamentals, defensives and\nundemanding valuations.\n\nWe favour a mix of quality growth and defensiveness in our sector strategy, with\nOverweight positions in IT, Communication Services, Utilities and Consumer\nStaples, and an Underweight position in Consumer Discretionary.\n\nUS – Gains driven by positive tariff and tax news\n\nS&P 500 Index climbed to near its all-time high levels, as forward\nprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and earnings forecast recovered to February and\nApril levels respectively. In addition to better-than-feared 1Q25 earnings and\nguidance, de-escalation of Middle East tensions and progress in trade talks\nboosted sentiment as well. The US and China finalised a trade understanding and\nthere could be imminent agreements with ten other major trading partners. A deal\nwas also reached with G-7 allies that excludes US companies from some taxes in\nexchange for removing the “revenge tax” proposal in Trump’s tax bill.\n\nFundamental growth could recover from late - 2025 onwards, although that is\nsomewhat priced in via an acceleration in 2026 earnings per share (EPS) growth\nforecast. Trump’s pro-growth policies (e.g. deregulation and tax cuts) are\nlikely to feature more prominently, especially with the US midterm elections in\n2026. Fiscal sustainability concerns would continue to drive a bearish outlook\nfor the US Dollar and partially support earnings, although offset by any\nincrease in long-end yields.\n\nEurope – Near-term uncertainties, long-term potential\n\nAfter a strong run since the start of the year, positioning and sentiment looks\nincreasingly stretched in the near term, making Europe tactically overbought.\nThese considerations, together with German stimulus news, as well as a risk of\nmixed headlines coming up in relation to trade negotiations with the US, are\nobstacles for a further run among Eurozone markets.\n\nOver the longer term, however, Europe’s growth is poised to strengthen, driven\nby i) stronger fiscal and defence spending and ii) a potential end to the\nRussia-Ukraine war that results in lower energy prices and higher confidence,\nbarring a significant escalation in trade tariffs and a slowdown in global\ngrowth. Coupled with rate cuts by the European Central Bank (ECB), Europe has\nboth a supportive fiscal and monetary backdrop. Valuations remain undemanding,\nand we maintain our Overweight position on European equities.\n\nWe continue to favour companies that ride on the tailwinds of defence, and\ninfrastructure spending, along with select names exposed to energy efficiency/\ntransition.\n\nJapan – Riding on the waves of higher wages, AI growth and rates\n\nJapanese equities have rebounded alongside global equity markets since the\nselloff from the “Liberation Day” tariff announcements. The MSCI Japan Index in\nUSD terms did better compared to its performance in Japanese yen (JPY) terms due\nto the appreciation of the latter. Given the positive correlation between USDJPY\nand Japanese equities, we believe this could exert some downward pressure on the\nMSCI Japan Index, with export-oriented names being more vulnerable. On the other\nhand, the expected appreciation in the JPY could provide an attractive option\nfor investors seeking to diversify from USD assets. Although we maintain our\nNeutral position on Japanese equities heading into 2H25, we believe investors\ncan position in i) domestic-oriented non-manufacturers with resilient overseas\noperations, as supported by rising wages, ii) companies that are beneficiaries\nof a higher interest rate environment and iii) AI plays. Corporate reforms also\nappear to be gathering momentum. Examples of ongoing initiatives include\nenhancing shareholder returns, business restructuring and improving corporate\ngovernance.\n\nAsia ex-Japan – Reiterating our Overweight position heading into 2H25\n\nThe MSCI Asia ex-Japan Index outperformed the MSCI ACWI Index (a measure of\nglobal equities) in 1H25, and we are maintaining our Overweight position on the\nformer heading into 2H25. Within the region, we reiterate our Overweight\npositions on China, Hong Kong, Singapore and the Philippines. We like Hong Kong,\nSingapore and the Philippines for their earnings resilience, as their respective\nMSCI equity indices have seen the smallest consensus downward revisions in 2025\nEPS year-to-date. For China, our current preference is for offshore equities in\nthe near term on the back of de-escalation in Sino-US trade tensions.\n\nWe are upgrading the South Korean equities. We believe political uncertainties\nhas been lifted with the conclusion of the presidential elections. An\nexpansionary fiscal policy has been earmarked by new President Lee Jae Myung,\nwhile the better-than-expected recovery in memory prices also buoyed sentiment\ntowards the South Korean stock market which is heavily weighted by semiconductor\nnames. Net flows from foreign institutional investors to South Korean equities\nhave been increasing, but foreign ownership is still well below historical\naverages. Our least preferred equity market is Thailand given increased\npolitical uncertainties and a subdued macroeconomic outlook.\n\nChina/HK – Silver lining in a bumpy market\n\nWhile US-China geopolitical tensions have de-escalated, we expect trade tensions\nto remain a key swing factor in 2H25. The temporary rollback in tariffs could\nlower the urgency for Chinese policymakers to roll out additional stimulus in\nthe upcoming July Politburo Meeting.\n\nWe remain constructive on Chinese equities on the back of near-term trade\nde-escalation, relatively upbeat 1Q25 results, undemanding valuations and low\npositioning among institutional investors. We prefer offshore Chinese equities\nin the near-term given a potentially slower roll out of additional stimulus. In\nterms of investment themes, we favour i) quality yield stocks considering the\nlower-for-longer interest rate environment, ii) internet and platform companies,\nas the latest quarterly results showed gaming to be a resilient segment, and the\nemergence of artificial intelligence (AI) application beneficiaries; and iii)\npolicy beneficiaries focusing on domestic consumption and technology innovation.\n\nWe are keeping an eye out on the decline in the Hong Kong interbank offered\nrates (HIBOR) which has been sharper than expected. This has implications for\nHong Kong stocks, especially banks and property, and companies that are highly\ngeared.\n\nGlobal Sectors - Divergence arising from sector-specific drivers\n\nAmidst the tariff announcements, geopolitical tensions and wars, and\ndevelopments relating to the US budget in 1H25, the Industrials and Financials\nsectors have led the pack, while Consumer Discretionary and Healthcare have\nlagged the rest. The Aerospace & Defence sub-sector is a major contributor to\nthe outperformance of the Industrials sector, while the Financials sector\nbenefitted from positive trends in loan growth and regulatory reform. The\nConsumer Discretionary sector has been weighed by tariff uncertainties and\nweaker consumer confidence, while Healthcare has been dragged by policy\nuncertainties, particularly around pharmaceutical tariffs, the most favoured\nnation policy and healthcare reforms in the US.\n\nTech bifurcating\n\nSemiconductor stocks saw a significant run-up in June on the back of increasing\noptimism. At its Advancing AI event, AMD introduced several new products in\nsemiconductors, software and services, and focused on its rack-scale solutions\nsuch as Helios. It also showcased several large tech partners, including Sam\nAltman (founder of OpenAI). Micron also reported an impressive set of results,\nwith AI benefiting the company on multiple fronts. These developments are giving\nfuel to the near-term momentum for semiconductor stocks, although valuations for\na number of names in the space are increasingly lofty at this juncture. On the\nother hand, share prices of marquee software names such as Adobe have been\nlagging given concerns around the pace of AI monetisation, but we believe the\nmarket might be overly pessimistic at this juncture.\n\nFavour a mix of quality growth and defensiveness\n\nWe favour a mix of quality growth and defensiveness in our sector strategy, with\nOverweights in IT, Communication Services, Utilities and Consumer Staples, and\nan Underweight on Consumer Discretionary. We have downgraded Consumer\nDiscretionary from Neutral to Underweight as the outlook for key sub-sectors\nsuch as autos, retail, apparel and luxury remains dim despite meaningful\ndownward earnings revisions amidst a challenging operating environment. Overall,\nthe global growth momentum has recently bounced back as tariff concerns have\neased, amongst other factors, but this may change given the possibility changing\npolicy or sentiment."}

We remain Neutral on duration. Long-end rates are vulnerable to\nfiscal and inflationary concerns but are biased downwards in the near term due\nto growth concerns.\n\nVasu Menon\nManaging Director\nGlobal Wealth Management\nOCBC Bank\n\nCredit markets have mostly shrugged off the latest round of geopolitical tension\nwith modest spread widening. Returns were resoundingly positive from rates and\nspread tightening. As risk premiums have mostly been priced out, we continue to\nretain a defensive posture across Developed Markets (DM) and Emerging Markets\n(EM), given little buffer against downside surprises. We continue to be Neutral\non duration.\n\nRates and US Treasuries\n\nDespite a de-escalation of the Middle East tension, US Treasuries (USTs) rallied\non the back of dovish Federal Reserve (Fed) comments, weak June consumer\nconfidence and headlines on the supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) reform for\nlarge banks.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell reiterated a consistent message: that the Fed has\nroom to be patient before considering easing monetary policy. However, there has\nbeen growing division where several governors expressed dovish comments. The\nincreasingly dovish tone has led to the futures market pricing in total cuts of\n28bps by September’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and 65bps by\nDecember. This is higher than our expectations. We continue to see\ntariff-related price pressures in the coming months.\n\nIn the coming month, investors will be watching tariffs and the US budget news\nclosely and these could potentially be market moving.\n\nWe remain Neutral on duration. We expect steeper curves as supply pressures\ncould cause long-end rates to underperform. The front-end will likely be\nanchored lower on expectations of an interest rate cut by the Fed.\n\nDeveloped markets\n\nAlthough US Treasury (UST) yields have been trending lower as markets anticipate\nweaker growth ahead, this has not been reflected in credit spreads which remain\nnear their tights for both Investment Grade (IG) and High Yield (HY) bonds.\n\nAs markets received a degree of relief from the now-suspended war in the Middle\nEast, there are several ongoing issues which may cause rates or equity market\nvolatility to rise over the near term. Hence, we see credit spreads are not\ncurrently pricing in much cushion for potential downside surprises – either from\neconomic data, or key announcements on tariffs and the US budget.\n\nAs such, we see potential for economic data to trend lower over 2H25. We believe\nadditional premiums need to be reflected in current environment. We continue to\nrecommend positioning in defensive sectors among Investment Grade bonds\n(utilities, pharmaceuticals, banks) and in High Yield BB-rated credits.\n\nWe hold a Neutral position on DM IG bonds and an Underweight position on DM HY\nbonds. We see risks skewed to wider spreads after the recent strong performance.\nYet, the outlook for growth remains on the downside.\n\nEM Corporates\n\nWith a wide range of variables and uncertainties in 2025, we remain Neutral on\nEM credits. The weaker global growth outlook and currency volatility could\ntranslate into wider EM spreads over the next 12 months, but supportive\ntechnical factors could be important mitigating considerations.\n\nAsia\n\nAsia has benefited from a better market sentiment, with IG outperforming HY in\nJune, supported by lower UST yields. However, within EM Corporates, Asia\nunderperformed its African and Latin American peers.\n\nWithin Asia, lower beta regions such as Singapore and South Korea posted lower\ntotal returns while the performance in longer duration profile segments such as\nIndonesia and Hong Kong were supported by lower UST yields. Macau, too, turned\nin strong monthly returns on improved gross gaming revenue (GGR).\n\nDespite renewed political turmoil, Thai credits largely performed in line with\nAsian peers. In the near term, we expect heightened internal political\nuncertainty and external headwinds from US tariff uncertainty to add pressure to\nan already soft economy. While we see risks of negative credit actions at the\nsovereign level and expect the weak macro environment to remain a drag on Thai\nbanks’ fundamentals, these are partially mitigated by adequate reserve coverage\nratios and strong capital ratios at the major Thai banks. We still expect\ncallable capital securities to be redeemed on the first call dates but would\nlike to be more selective in the space. We will be closely monitoring asset\nquality trends at the banks, economic trends, and political developments in\nThailand, as well as Thailand’s trade negotiations with the US.\n\nIn the near term, we expect USTs to stay volatile, due to trade policy\nuncertainties, the debt ceiling X-date possibly in August, and a worsening US\nbudget deficit. As such, we retain a quality bias for Asian credits."}
{"article_title": "Back to fundamentals after geopolitical tensions ease", "publish_date": "2025-07-01", "url": "https://www.ocbc.com//premier-banking/market-insights/fx-and-commodities", "source": "OCBC", "content": "If there is a lasting Iran-Israel ceasefire, oil prices could eventually fall\nback to pre-13 June levels of around mid-US$60s/barrel, helped by OPEC+ using\nits spare capacity to bring back volumes on an accelerated timeframe.\n\nVasu Menon\nManaging Director\nGlobal Wealth Management\nOCBC Bank\n\nOil\n\nOil prices fell sharply, as the threat of a wider regional conflict did not\nmaterialise despite US action against Iranian nuclear sites. Crude oil prices\nretreated from a high of over US$80/barrel in late June amid signs that the\nIran-Israel ceasefire is holding. It is too early to expect any discussion on\nIranian sanction relief. However, President Donald Trump did cause some\nconfusion when he made some unexpected statements that China can continue to\npurchase Iranian oil. He also said that his commitment to the “maximum pressure”\ncampaign, aimed at curbing Iran’s oil exports, remains in place.\n\nIf there is a lasting ceasefire, we see room for Brent oil to revisit the May\nlow of US$60/barrel. Should the ceasefire be maintained, this could lower the\nrisk of severe damage to oil infrastructure in the region or a closure of the\nStrait of Hormuz, a critical gateway for global oil shipments. This would see\nthe geopolitical risk premium erode. Oil prices could eventually fall back to\npre-13 June levels in the mid-US$60s/barrel, helped by OPEC+ using its spare\ncapacity to bring back volumes on an accelerated timeframe, as well as the\nseasonal drop in oil demand after summer.\n\nPrecious metals\n\nGold’s recent rally had unwound as geopolitical risks eased. Gold could slip\nback into consolidation mode. However, we remain bullish on gold in the medium\nterm and expect gold prices to rise to US$3,900/ounce in a year’s time. The\noptimism in risk assets, reinforced by hopes of friendly US inflation data and a\nmild softening in the job markets - paving the way for earlier Federal Reserve\nrate cuts, can lessen the demand for safe havens like gold. High gold prices are\nalso starting to hurt demand, especially demand for jewellery. Nevertheless, we\nexpect that gold’s price dip will stimulate demand for hedging against the risk\nof a US recession. Gold is also likely to remain well supported by\nstill-elevated central bank buying.\n\nGold is not cheap, but we see its safe haven appeal to be the most compelling\nrelative to the Japanese Yen and Swiss Fran. Hedging value for geopolitical risk\nremains an important part of why we are positive on gold, even though it is hard\nto time geopolitical events. A recent World Gold Council (WGC) survey supports\nour view that gold demand from central banks will remain structurally higher. A\nrecord 43% of central banks plan to increase their gold reserves over the next\n12 months, according to the survey. This is up from 29% a year ago and is the\nhighest level seen in eight years, according to WGC data.\n\nCurrency\n\nFor the month of June, the US Dollar (USD) initially saw mild demand on\ngeopolitical escalation in Middle East, but demand quickly faded after a\nceasefire in the Israel-Iran conflict. Subsequently, the USD took a turn lower,\nwith the USD Index (DXY) testing more than a three-year low into month-end. Some\nof the factors that contributed to renewed USD selling pressure include\ntentative optimism about trade talks, prospects of rate cuts by the US Federal\nReserve (Fed) and softer US data (reinforcing the view that US exceptionalism is\neroding), while geopolitical concerns took a back seat. Recent comments from Fed\nofficials have indicated that a rate cut in July is a possibility. In the near\nterm, reciprocal tariffs remain a key focus, as markets watch for potential new\ndeals or extensions. We continue to expect the USD to trade weaker as the USD\ndiversification/re-allocation trend takes centre-stage while potential for a Fed\nrate-cut cycle comes into focus in 2H2025.\n\nThe Euro (EUR) extended its run higher as the USD lost ground. Germany’s\ngovernment recently approved its draft budget for 2025, clearing the way for a\nbig boost in spending on defence and infrastructure. Defence spending is set to\nmore than double to €152.8 billion by 2029. In addition, NATO members have\nagreed to ramp up military spending to 5% of GDP. All of this supports our view\nthat fiscal policy will be a tailwind for German growth in the years ahead, and\nthat should be a positive for the EUR as well. A risk factor on the radar is\nEU-US tariffs. Potential repercussions if the US imposes significant tariffs on\nEU goods include a reduction in EU exports to US, growth concerns about the EU\nand deeper ECB rate cuts to support growth. Technically this can hold back the\nEUR’s rally but if the “sell USD” trade remains the dominant theme, then the EUR\nmay still find support.\n\nThe exchange rate between the Australian Dollar and the USD (AUDUSD) rose as an\nIsrael-Iran ceasefire supported risk sentiment while tentative trade deals\nbetween the US and a few nations including China and the UK, and dovish Fed\nrhetoric, undermined the USD. More broadly, Australia’s growth remains intact,\nbut the pace of recovery is expected to moderate, due to weaker global demand,\ntrade related uncertainties and softer domestic consumption. Slower inflation\nand a less tight labour market allows the RBA to continue it gradual path of\neasing monetary policy. This should be perceived as one of the means of\nsupporting growth. The AUD is a high beta currency which can be exposed to\ngeopolitical shocks, swings in the Renminbi (RMB), equity market sentiment, and\nglobal growth prospects. The interplay of a dovish RBA and tariff uncertainty\nare factors that will restrain the AUD from heading higher. On the other hand, a\nsofter USD trend could cushion the impact on the AUD. The bias remains for the\nAUD to trend gradually higher as USD softness returns and markets re-focus on\npotential Fed rate cuts in the months ahead.\n\nThe relatively strong performance amongst Asian currency markets was largely due\nto the \"sell USD\" trade, signs of foreign inflows returning, prospects of a\nde-escalation in trade tensions as the US engages in trade talks with a handful\nof Asian countries including China, South Korea and Japan, as well as chatters\nof currency being discussed with some Asian countries during bilateral trade\ntalks with the US. “Sell USD” trade is due to a range of reasons from US policy\nunpredictability related to Trump’s tariffs, to an erosion of US exceptionalism\nand increasing concerns over US fiscal health. These factors can continue to\nhurt sentiment towards the USD. As the confidence in the USD starts to waver\nafter geopolitical tensions fade, exporters in the region and asset managers\nwill continue to reduce their USD holdings. Asian currencies can continue to\nappreciate so long as USD softness persists owing to US-centric risks and if\nglobal growth outside US holds up. But the momentum could be jeopardised if US\nexceptionalism makes a comeback, if global growth shows further signs of\nweakening, or if there is a systematic crisis/geopolitical setback.\n\nUSDCNY - the exchange rate between the USD and the onshore Renminbi (RMB)\ncontinued to trade in a subdued ranges near its recent lows. A consistent trend\nof CNY fix being set stronger, relatively upbeat PMIs, confirmation of a trade\ndeal framework between the US and China, as well as a softer USD environment\nshould continue to point to a more constructive outlook for the RMB. But at the\nsame time, we believe policymakers will continue to pursue setting the USDCNY\nfix at a \"measured pace\" to also help anchor relative stability in the RMB\noverall. Any sharp or rapid RMB appreciation may risk triggering exporters\nrushing to sell USD holdings and that cycle (if it happens) may result in\nexcessive RMB volatility and strength. This may hurt exporters’ margins and have\nwider repercussion on deflation. A more gradual pace of appreciation could\nrepair investor sentiment and encourage a return of foreign inflows.\n\nThe exchange rate between the US Dollar and the Singapore Dollar (USDSGD)\ncontinued to trade near a decade low. A combination of tentative progress on\ntrade talks, a soft USD environment, a stronger RMB and a de-escalation of\ngeopolitical tensions were some factors that undermined the pair. On the\nupcoming MAS policy meeting in July, we are of the view that there may be little\nurgency to ease after two back-to-back easing in January and April this year. A\njoint statement by the MAS and MTI noted that imported inflation should remain\nmoderate. Domestically, enhanced government subsidies for essential services are\nlikely to dampen services inflation. Overall, core and headline inflation are\nprojected to average 0.5 – 1.5% for 2025 (unchanged from the previous MAS-MTI\nstatement). Nevertheless, earlier downgrades to growth and inflation projections\nfor 2025 alongside a highly uncertain external environment suggests that the\ndoor remains open for further easing, should macroeconomic conditions\ndeteriorate further."}

The deal\nwould also see Japan invest USD 550bn in the US, as well as make additional\npurchases of agricultural goods.\n\nThe agreement with the Philippines set a 19% rate, the same level as Indonesia\nagreed and just below Vietnam’s 20% baseline level. Separately, US Treasury\nSecretary Scott Bessent said he will meet his Chinese counterpart in Stockholm\nnext week for their third round of talks, while Trump told reporters that the US\nis “getting along with China very well.”\n\nThe latest developments are in line with our view that greater clarity on the\nadministration’s trade policy should take shape in the coming months. We see\nseveral factors for investors to consider as they navigate the markets from\nhere.\n\nThe rebound in equities since the post-“Liberation Day” low may have emboldened\nTrump to maximize his pressure tactics to increase his leverage in bilateral\nnegotiations by sending out trade letters threatening higher trade levies. But\nthe better-than-expected outcome with Japan suggests that the administration\nremains wary of the economic impact if a no-deal scenario leads to retaliatory\nactions from trading partners. For example, the European Commission is preparing\ncountermeasures against US services as well as goods, according to media\nreports. We maintain the view that the US administration will not want tariffs\nso high that they choke off trade, fuel inflation, or push the economy into\nrecession.\n\nThe trade agreements Trump has announced so far are more of a handshake deal\nrather than a comprehensive, binding pact that would normally take one to three\nyears to reach. Our view is that “reciprocal” tariffs based on the International\nEmergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) are likely to be declared illegal by the\nUS Supreme Court later this year or early next year. But the tariff wall can be\nrebuilt through other routes, including sectoral tariffs on national security\ngrounds based on Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. While sectoral\ntariffs could be more durable, they take longer to be implemented. The lower\ntariffs on Japanese autos and the provision of a grace period for pharmaceutical\nimports could also suggest that these levies may not be as punitive as Trump had\npreviously threatened.\n\n. While this represents a sixfold increase over tariff levels in 2024, such a\nrate is well below what was threatened in the immediate aftermath of “Liberation\nDay.” These tariffs will likely have a negative impact on US growth and will\nboost US inflation, but we believe the US economy should avoid a recession as\naggregate household balance sheets remain strong. An uptick in market\nvolatility, however, remains likely as fresh headlines emerge. A\nlarger-than-expected impact showing up in economic data could also dampen\ninvestor sentiment, where optimism has prevailed so far.\n\nSo, we see further equity gains over the next 12 months but think investors\nshould consider ways to manage potential volatility in the near term, including\nstructured investments and phasing-in strategies. Investors can also build\nlonger-term exposure to our Transformational Innovation Opportunities of\nArtificial intelligence, Power and resources, and Longevity.\n\nFor Japan, the lower tariffs on autos could translate into a\n0.4-percentage-point improvement in the country’s real GDP growth this year and\nagain in 2026. The deal also removes a key downside risk for the Japanese yen,\nand we reiterate our view that USDJPY should trend lower over the medium term,\nespecially since we expect the Federal Reserve to resume policy easing later\nthis year. In the near term, we expect USDJPY volatility until there is clarity\nover Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s future, and we favor selling USDJPY on\nrallies as well as selling the upside price risk for yield pickup. Among\nJapanese equities, we favor additional exposure to oversold and high-quality\ncyclical stocks in the auto, machinery, and health care sectors, as we believe\nthey offer appealing medium-term returns."}

The Magnificent 7, a group of top US growth and tech\nfirms, posted a 9th consecutive gain, the best run since 2023. This comes ahead\nof results on 23 July from Alphabet and Tesla. Investor sentiment was buoyed by\nan encouraging start to the second-quarter earnings season, and there appears to\nbe a respite in US President Donald Trump’s tariff threats in recent days as\ntrade negotiations continue.\n\nWe expect market volatility to pick up in the lead-up to the 1 August tariff\ndeadline, with threats to Federal Reserve independence and geopolitical\nuncertainty lingering in the background.\n\nBut we also believe near-term market swings offer investors an opportunity to\nbuild exposure to our Transformational Innovation Opportunities (TRIO) of\nArtificial intelligence, Power and resources, and Longevity, as innovation\nremains key to long-term equity gains.\n\nDespite a 7% average earnings per share (EPS) beat, the share prices of tech\ncompanies that have already reported have declined by 5% on average\npost-earnings. This reflects investors’ heightened expectations, in our view,\nespecially following the strong market rebound over the past few months. But\nwhile we expect volatility ahead amid potential semiconductor tariffs and\nAI-related restrictions, our conviction in AI remains intact. Global AI capital\nspending is on track to grow by 60% this year and another 33% in 2026 to USD\n480bn, based on our forecasts, and monetization trends have been encouraging\nwith rising AI adoption. In fact, rising use cases across industries suggest\noverall AI adoption is far from a peak. We continue to advocate for balanced\nexposure across the AI value chain.\n\nGlobal electricity consumption is accelerating, increasingly overcoming the\nmitigating effect of efficiency gains that kept a lid on power generation and\ngrid infrastructure needs in recent decades. According to forecasts by the\nInternational Energy Agency, electricity use is projected to grow at nearly 4%\nannually through 2027, equivalent to adding more than Japan’s entire consumption\neach year. This robust trajectory for demand is not only encountering\nconstraints on new electrical infrastructure, but also the reality that much of\nthe existing foundation is approaching or past end-of-life. Roughly 40% of\nEurope’s distribution grids are more than 40 years old, 70% of transmission\nlines in the US are more than 25 years old, and the average US nuclear power\nplant is operating beyond its initial 40-year license. We believe investments\nalong the electrification value chain will remain critical.\n\nWhile tariff uncertainty re-emerged for US pharmaceutical imports after\nPresident Trump threatened tariffs of up to 200% on imported drugs, large-cap\npharmaceutical firms have already announced significant capital investments in\nUS manufacturing, and research and development. A potential 12- to 18-month\ntransition period has alleviated the immediate risk of sudden levies, and\nmarkets appear to have viewed the rhetoric as more of a negotiating tactic than\nimminent policy. We continue to expect a rapidly expanding longevity market,\nwith health care, wellness, and related sectors poised to capture a growing\nshare of global profits as populations age.\n\nSo, we expect our TRIO themes to offer durable, secular growth that we believe\ncan persist well beyond short-term market volatility. In addition to direct\nexposure to these opportunities, investors can also consider structured\nstrategies for more defensive positioning."}

Earnings guidance for the current\nquarter has also been better than expected.\n\nWith valuations at an elevated level and the market having just experienced one\nof its strongest pre-earnings season rebounds, the current reporting season may\nnot be enough of a catalyst to drive stocks much higher in the near term. Bouts\nof volatility are likely in the coming weeks as trade negotiations continue\nahead of the new 1 August tariff deadline.\n\nBut we continue to expect further gains over the next year, and believe the\nresilient results so far are a step in the right direction.\n\nDespite continued uncertainty on tariffs and trade policy, US economic data have\nremained healthy. Retail sales in June grew more than expected, with broad-based\nadvances. Since consumer spending accounts for around 70% of US economic\nactivity, JPMorgan’s recent comments that it is struggling to find signs of\nweakness in consumer spending point to a resilient economy that should continue\nto underpin corporate profits. Delta Airlines, in its earnings call, also\ndescribed the US economy as solid and its core customer as being in good shape.\n\nHistorically, every 10% change in the US dollar has translated into a roughly\n2.5% increase in S&P 500 profits. While we could see some near-term support for\nthe dollar, its structural decline remains in motion and will likely become more\napparent as economic data weakens later this year. We expect a weaker greenback\nto continue to boost year-over-year profit growth for the balance of the year.\n\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill, which was signed into law earlier this month,\nincludes provisions that should drive a modest boost to near-term cash flows and\nprovide incentives for capital spending.

A\nsmall step up in capital expenditures is also possible, which is usually\nbeneficial for corporate profits as one company’s investment spending is another\ncompany’s revenue.\n\nSo, while stocks may be due for a breather, we believe the bull market remains\nintact.

When asked if he ruled out removal, he\nsaid, “I don’t rule out anything, but I think it’s highly unlikely.” Senior\nofficials, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, have also publicly\nrefuted the reports.\n\nFinancial markets responded to the initial headlines with a move into defensive\nassets such as US Treasuries and gold, while the US dollar weakened, and\nequities experienced brief volatility before stabilizing on Trump’s rebuttal. As\nof publication, prediction markets are pricing a roughly 21% probability that\nPowell will not remain in his role in 2025.\n\nWhile we continue to view the probability of a change in Fed leadership as low,\nrecent developments have prompted increased attention from both policymakers and\ninvestors. Although the situation remains speculative, we outline several\nconsiderations for global investors:\n\nA move to dismiss the Fed chair could raise questions about the long-term\ncredibility of US monetary policy and the Fed's independence, which has\nhistorically been viewed as a key pillar of the financial system. This comes at\na time when there are already concerns about US fiscal sustainability,\ninflation, and the dollar as a store of value. Such a development could prompt\ninvestors to demand higher risk premiums on US government debt, especially if it\nleads to greater uncertainty around inflation or interest rate policy.\nAggressive rate cuts under political pressure might not lead to lower bond\nyields across the curve, as investors could begin pricing in higher inflation\nrisks. Such developments might also have adverse implications for the US\ndollar’s role as a global reserve currency.\n\nWhile the president has the authority to initiate removal proceedings “for\ncause” against a Federal Reserve governor, the legal standards and their\napplicability to the chair remain subject to interpretation. No Fed governor has\never been sacked “for cause.” The framework for Fed independence, established by\nthe 1951 Treasury-Fed accord, has endured previous political challenges. Any\nattempt to remove the chair would likely result in a protracted legal process,\nwith recent Supreme Court decisions generally upholding the Federal Reserve’s\ninstitutional protections. Ultimately, the courts would determine whether the\ngrounds for removal meet the legal threshold. There is potentially legislation\nthat Congress could pursue, changing the Fed’s mandates or taking away Fed\nindependence. It would be hard to get this through the Senate where 60 votes\nwould be needed, but just an attempt to get it through the House could impact\nmarkets.\n\nUS monetary policy decisions are made collectively by the Federal Open Market\nCommittee, rather than by the chair alone. Currently, only a minority of voting\nmembers have expressed support for rate cuts in July. Even if a new chair were\nappointed, the overall composition of the committee would remain largely\nunchanged in the near term, and Jerome Powell could continue to serve as a\ngovernor until 2028. FOMC members have sworn an oath to pursue the mandates\nestablished by Congress, so unless the labor market gets much worse, there is a\nlimit to how much the Fed might cut even under a new dovish chair. Therefore, a\nchange in leadership would not necessarily result in a material shift in policy\ndirection. That said, the rotation of regional Fed presidents, existing\ngovernors, and governor Kugler’s forthcoming departure in January is set to\nshift the composition of voting members in a dovish direction in any event.\n\nWe will continue to monitor developments and market responses to any further\nnews regarding Fed leadership. Chair Powell’s upcoming remarks will be closely\nwatched for any indication of a shift in the Fed’s stance. Despite recent\nheadlines, our base case remains unchanged: We expect the Federal Reserve to cut\nrates by a total of 100 basis points starting in September, with decisions\nguided primarily by labor market and inflation data. In this environment, we\nanticipate the US dollar will consolidate in the near term following its recent\ndecline. We continue to view current EURUSD levels around 1.16 as consistent\nwith our year-end target of 1.21. As rates fall, we see value in focusing on\nmore durable sources of income, particularly through allocations to high grade\nand investment grade bonds. Gold would also stand to benefit from any\nuncertainty around Fed independence, as well as continuing investment and\ncentral bank demand and our expectation for lower real rates. We reiterate our\nforecast for prices near USD 3,500/oz by year-end."}

The tech-heavy Nasdaq has climbed more than 35%\nfrom its April lows, setting a fresh record on Tuesday. NVIDIA, meanwhile,\nbecame the first company to reach a USD 4 trillion valuation, and has won US\napproval to sell once-banned chips into China.\n\nThis resurgence reflects growing optimism that the large-cap tech giants will\ncontinue delivering robust earnings growth, despite lingering concerns over\ntariffs and regulatory risks. Among the early results, Taiwan-based semi foundry\nTSMC posted a record quarterly profit, surpassing market expectations for both\nearnings and on forward guidance. Shares in semi capital-equipment maker ASML\nfell 10% on Wednesday after disappointing third-quarter 2025 guidance and new\nuncertainty over its 2026 growth outlook.\n\nAhead of a run of major second-quarter results, we make several observations:\n\nThe Magnificent 7’s rapid growth rates over the last two years have been a\ndominant driver of S&P 500 earnings per share growth. Profit growth for these\nmega-cap companies should remain strong at around 20% in the second quarter. But\nthis would be a downshift from near 30% growth in each of the previous four\nquarters. On balance, we think earnings for this cohort are likely to remain\nsolid going forward on the back of ongoing AI deployment and adoption. This\noutlook for industry growth rates was also supported by the latest guidance from\nTSMC, which also pointed toward a normalization.\n\nThe recent rally in large-cap tech and AI stocks has been fueled mainly by\nprice-to-earnings (P/E) multiple expansion. While we remain structurally bullish\non AI, we would prefer to see further gains underpinned by upward\nearnings-per-share (EPS) revisions rather than valuation expansion alone.\nSustainable growth in the sector will ultimately depend on continued improvement\nin profitability and operational performance\n\nGenerative AI-driven capacity investments should benefit the semiconductor\ncapital equipment sector (semicaps) across logic and memory, but we see these\ngains materializing over a longer horizon. In the near term, we remain defensive\non the subsector given ongoing uncertainty around consumer semiconductor\nrecovery, new capacity in China, and the broader economic outlook into 2026.\nGrowth dispersion is already evident: AI semiconductor revenues are rising\n60-70% at the chip level, 25-30% at foundries, but only 5-10% at the equipment\nlevel. With limited visibility and heightened tariff risk, we recommend\ninvestors focus on only the highest-quality semicap names.\n\nSo we go into this earnings season anticipating healthy earnings growth and\nencouraging guidance from tech, with a structurally bullish view on AI and the\nopportunity set intact. However, earnings surprises in the coming weeks may also\nplay a key role in shaping near-term sentiment, especially amid more demanding\nvaluations. We think strong AI capex trends and supportive currency dynamics\nwill continue to underpin the longer-term opportunity, and we forecast 12%\nglobal tech profit growth in 2025. We recommend investors focus on these\nlong-term fundamentals, and seek diversified exposure across semiconductors,\nsoftware, and internet platforms, rather than concentrating risk in any single\nsegment or individual stock."}

The latest labor data suggest that US companies have yet to\nstart laying off workers, and investor sentiment has remained resilient, with\nthe S&P 500 near its all-time high.\n\nBut inflation is beginning to show signs of picking up. The consumer price index\n(CPI) rose 0.3% in June, up from 0.1% in May, pushing the annual inflation rate\nto 2.7%—its highest level since February. Core inflation, which excludes food\nand energy, increased 0.2% on the month, up from 0.1% in the prior month,\nbringing the annual rate to 2.9%. While these figures were in line with\nexpectations, they highlight the gradual impact of tariffs on prices. Apparel\nand household furnishings, which are tariff-sensitive categories, saw price\nincreases, while vehicle prices declined.\n\nMarkets will now turn their focus to economic data in the coming days, including\nthe producer price index, retail sales, industrial production, and the\nUniversity of Michigan consumer sentiment survey. These reports will help\ninvestors gauge the health of the US economy and assess the Federal Reserve’s\nnext move.\n\nOur base case remains for the US central bank to resume policy easing in\nSeptember, bringing interest rates 100 basis points lower over the next 12\nmonths.\n\nWhile the June inflation data showed mixed evidence of tariff-related price\npressures, we believe the US effective tariff rate will settle at around 15%,\nlifting inflation only modestly. Tariffs are gradually impacting retail prices—a\ntrend we expect to persist through 2026, and any upward surprises in inflation\ncould complicate the Fed's ability to justify rate cuts. However, core services\ninflation, despite flattening recently, should start trending lower again,\nhelping to prevent overall inflation from rising sharply—even if some tariffs\nare increased further on 1 August. Notably, shelter inflation, which accounts\nfor over 35% of the CPI and has been the biggest single driver of overall\ninflation, is expected to continue slowing. This, coupled with a weaker labor\nmarket, should allow the central bank to cut rates later this year.\n\nWhile the US economy added more jobs than expected last month, the details of\nthe labor report were weaker than the headline numbers. Private sector payrolls\nincreased at the slowest pace since October last year, while average hourly\nearnings rose at the lower end of the post-pandemic range. The labor\nparticipation rate also fell to its lowest level since December 2022. These data\npoints suggest that labor demand is deteriorating, as businesses are cautious\nabout long-term hiring plans amid trade and economic headwinds.\n\nWe do not expect a rate cut at the Fed’s policy meeting later this month.\nHowever, the fact that some officials favored a reduction as soon as July\nsuggests that policymakers are alert to softening economic activity and falling\nconsumer confidence. We continue to expect the Fed to react according to\navailable data, while speeches by a number of Fed officials later this week may\ngive markets additional insights into the US central bank’s path toward further\neasing.\n\nSo, we think the appeal of cash will be further eroded as rates fall later this\nyear. Investors should lock in more durable sources of income, including through\nhigh grade and investment grade bonds. Long-term investors can also consider\ndiversified fixed income strategies."}

An easing of restrictions follows a high-profile White House\nmeeting between NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang and US President Donald Trump last week,\nwhere Huang reportedly warned that curbing AI chip sales abroad could risk\nforfeiting US leadership in artificial intelligence to Chinese competitors. The\ncompany’s mid-tier H20 chip had previously been banned under April's US export\nrestrictions imposed by the Trump administration, resulting in a USD 5.5bn\ninventory write-off and the loss of a key sales market for NVIDIA. Media reports\nalso indicate that NVIDIA is developing a new, lower-tier AI chip for China that\nfully complies with US export controls.\n\nThe relaxation of the US chip restrictions comes amid broader tariff and trade\nnegotiations with China, with Beijing said to seek more access to advanced AI\nchips. Details are not yet fully clear, but reports suggest Huang will brief the\nmedia from China on Tuesday, where he is meeting with partners, customers, and\ntop Chinese officials. Separately, the Malaysian government announced new\nrestrictions on the export and transit of high-performance AI chips, following\nreports of illegal re-exports to countries subject to stricter US chip controls.\n\nWhile the latest China chip headlines are encouraging, we see them as just one\nof several important considerations for investors focused on the sector:\n\nWithout taking any single-company views, the resumption of some US AI chip sales\nin China would add to already robust global demand for AI chips, which has been\ngrowing this year on both sovereign AI deals in Europe and the Middle East and\nthanks to solid US large-cap tech capex. While the H20 news is a clear positive\ndevelopment for broader sentiment, the muted share price reaction in North\nAsia's tech sector suggests investors at least partially anticipated it. We\nthink an easing of US restrictions would benefit select stocks across\nsemiconductor contract manufacturing, advanced memory makers, the AI data center\nand server supply chain, and select China-based data center operators. Large-cap\nChina tech firms may also benefit from easier access to leading AI compute and\ninference capacity.\n\nWhile the China H20 headlines are constructive for the sector, the landscape\nremains complex. Malaysia’s new export control regime, while potentially a\npositive for local data center operators, comes after reports of intensifying US\nscrutiny on how advanced AI chip exports to the country are used and potentially\nresold to restricted nations. The Trump administration has also started\nthreatening higher tariffs ahead of its self-imposed 1 August negotiating\ndeadline. Semiconductors may face sector-specific tariffs, with uncertainty over\nthe longevity of current carveouts. Investors will need to manage both positive\nand negative policy developments, as well as increased volatility in the near\nterm.\n\nSecond-quarter results from key large-cap tech and semiconductor companies in\nthe coming week should provide a clearer understanding on underlying demand and\nsector fundamentals. We note that the recent rally in large-cap tech and AI\nstocks has been fueled mainly by price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple expansion.\nWhile we remain structurally bullish on AI, we would prefer to see further gains\nunderpinned by upward earnings-per-share (EPS) revisions rather than valuation\nexpansion alone. Sustainable growth in the sector will ultimately depend on\ncontinued improvement in profitability and operational performance, not just\npositive headlines or policy shifts.\n\nSo while the resumption of NVIDIA H20 chip sales to China would be a\nconstructive development for the AI theme and the semiconductor sector,\ninvestors should remain mindful of the broader risks. Pockets of elevated\nvaluations across leading AI companies, ongoing geopolitical uncertainty, and\nthe upcoming second-quarter earnings season all point to the need for a balanced\nand selective approach. We recommend investors seek diversified exposure across\nsemiconductors, software, and internet platforms, rather than concentrating risk\nin any single segment or individual stock. Strong AI capex trends and supportive\ncurrency dynamics underpin the longer-term opportunity, and we forecast 12%\nglobal tech profit growth in 2025."}
{"article_title": "Trump tests market optimism over trade", "publish_date": "2025-07-14", "url": "https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealthmanagement/insights/chief-investment-office/house-view/daily/2025/latest-14072025.onlycontent.html", "source": "UBS", "content": "(6 min)\n(6 min)\n\n\n\nUS President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to impose 30% tariffs on\nimports from the European Union and Mexico, capping a week in which he went back\non the offensive in negotiations with trade partners. The Stoxx Europe 600 index\nis down 0.5% at the time of writing, while S&P 500 futures for Monday's session\nare trading 0.5% lower. The EURUSD exchange rate is little changed at just below\n1.17.\n\nIn a social media post, the president described his nation’s trade deficit as a\nrisk to national security. The escalation in trade tensions comes after last\nweek’s expiration of a 90-day pause on most of the “Liberation Day” tariffs\nannounced by the White House on 2 April. There was a steady stream of trade\nthreats through the week, starting with the delivery of a batch of letters to 14\nnations announcing that higher tariffs would be introduced on 1 August unless\nfurther concessions were made. The administration also indicated it would\nimplement a 50% tariff on copper imports, along with duties of up to 200% on\npharmaceuticals entering the US.\n\nThe more aggressive stance on tariffs has so far failed to shake investor\noptimism. The S&P 500 struck an all-time high late in the week, and even after a\n0.3% decline on Friday, the index is up 25.7% from its low for the year on 8\nApril, when concerns over trade were most intense. This hopeful reaction\ncontrasts with the 12% fall in US stocks in the week following Trump’s\n“Liberation Day” address on 2 April, in which he outlined a series of\n“reciprocal” tariffs on US trading partners that run goods trade surpluses with\nthe US.\n\n\n\nDespite the noise, we believe the most likely scenario remains that the US\neffective tariff rate ends the year at around 15%. IEEPA tariffs are likely to\nbe declared illegal by the US Supreme Court, in our view, but not until later\nthis year or early next year. President Trump's changeable use of the IEEPA in\nthe past week, to justify tariffs on Brazil, further bolsters our view. The\ntariff wall can be rebuilt through other routes, such as country and product\ntariffs, but would be much more limited in scope.\n\nSo, how do the latest events fit with this view? The resilience of US economic\ndata and stocks rising to fresh highs appear to have emboldened President Trump\nto maximize his pressure tactics to increase his leverage in bilateral trade\nnegotiations. Taken together, the current proposed tariffs would lift the US\neffective tariff rate close to or even above 2 April levels.\n\nIf the administration were to implement the aforementioned tariffs on 1 August\nand leave them at those levels, the likelihood of a US profits and economic\nrecession would increase. US Treasury Secretary Bessent understands the\nimportance of not lifting tariffs to a level that would risk harming economic\nactivity, particularly since the deficit-to-GDP ratio will remain around 7% over\nthe next few years following the passage of the OBBBA. A Wall Streat Journal\nreport citing an unnamed US official who claims that Canada and Mexico tariffs\nwill receive USMCA exemption suggests the administration is at least aware of\nthe potential damage.\n\nWe therefore believe that the administration is using this latest round of\ntariff escalation to maximize its negotiating leverage and that it will\nultimately de-escalate, especially if there is a new bout of heightened bond and\nstock market volatility.\n\nWith respect to the European Union (EU), our base case remains that the two\nsides will likely reach an agreement before 1 August, or the administration will\nextend the deadline again while negotiations are ongoing. However, the US\npresident’s seemingly maximalist and aggressive demands—including “complete,\nopen market access to the United States, with no tariff being charged to\nus”—make it difficult to predict the EU’s response. There is now a\nnon-negligible risk that trade tensions between the EU and the US escalate,\nwhich would be damaging for both economies.\n\nOn our estimates, European economic growth in the second half of the year could\neasily turn negative as weaker external demand and further declines in business\nconfidence, investment, and hiring weigh on activity. In this scenario, as per\nthe European Central Bank’s June forecasts, we would expect the central bank to\nease rates by more than currently anticipated, potentially approaching 1% in the\ncoming months. For more on this, read our blog, .\n\nTurning to Mexico, in his letter threatening the 30% tariffs, President Trump\nacknowledged Mexico’s recent progress on border security but stressed that more\naction is needed against drug cartels and existing trade barriers. Our view is\nthat all three areas are moving in the right direction.\n\nWe do not expect Mexico to retaliate in a disruptive way and although details\nare still emerging, it appears the 30% tariff would apply only to a small share\nof trade that is not compliant with the USMCA trade pact. This suggests the risk\nof a major trade conflict is low. The upcoming review of the USMCA agreement is\nbecoming increasingly relevant. We expect the agreement to remain in place, even\nif negotiations bring greater US demands. For more on this, read our blog, .\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration looks likely to persist with its confrontational\nnegotiating tactics, which could lead to renewed market swings. It is also\npossible that the White House will only back away from its latest threats if the\nmarket falls. We have been advising investors to take steps to bolster the\nresilience of their portfolios against this uncertain backdrop. This includes\nthe following:\n\nIn our view, any further rise in the S&P 500 this year is likely to be limited\nbefore greater policy clarity and renewed Federal Reserve easing help push the\nmarket higher in 2026. One way to manage near-term risks is to phase into\nequities, building exposure gradually and taking advantage of pockets of\nvolatility. US technology, health care, and financials; select Asian tech\nsectors (Taiwan, India, mainland China); and quality or thematic plays in Europe\nall offer attractive growth prospects. Early allocation allows investors to\ncapitalize on these trends as they unfold.\n\nThese can include an allocation to gold, which has proven to be a reliable hedge\nagainst geopolitical and policy uncertainty over recent years. We believe a\nmid-single-digit percentage allocation to gold in a USD portfolio can diversify\nand hedge against political risk and inflation. A modest allocation to select\nhedge funds can enhance portfolio resilience, take advantage of volatility, and\nsmooth overall return outcomes. Finally, any renewed market swings can be used\nto lock in gains and make portfolios more defensive with capital preservation\nstrategies.\n\nInnovation remains a key driver of long-term equity performance and an important\nfeature of enduring market leaders. Structural shifts in AI, energy\ninfrastructure, and health care are expanding global profit pools and reshaping\nindustries. We expect our TRIO themes— Artificial intelligence, Power and\nresources, and Longevity—to offer durable, secular growth that we believe can\npersist well beyond short-term market volatility.\n\nThe USD’s traditional role as a perceived “safe haven” is being called into\nquestion. Investors have already begun reassessing excess exposure to USD assets\namid increasingly unpredictable US policymaking. Further near-term uncertainty\nis likely to give support to perceived \"safe haven\" currencies and commodities\nlike the CHF (and to some degree the JPY) versus the USD. The euro has been the\nmain currency for many to express concerns around the resilience of the US\neconomy and the US dollar. Although it is hard to judge the short-term market\nreaction, the prospects of lower US growth and the Fed having room to cut US\ninterest rates favor a weaker USD. We therefore like to make use of any EURUSD\npullback to position for an exchange rate move to 1.20 or higher over the coming\nquarters."}

The Wall Street Journal also reports Canadian\nnegotiators are “increasingly resigned” to an eventual end-deal that includes\nsome form of new tariffs.\n\nThis latest move comes on the heels of similar actions targeting numerous other\ntrading partners, reinforcing our expectations for more disruptive tariff\nheadlines and developments into US-imposed negotiating deadlines. We make\nseveral observations from this latest episode:\n\nThe 35% headline figure on Canadian imports sounds high, and indeed would be\ndestructive if applied to all trade given the deep integration of the two\ncountries' supply chains and economies. However, the impact depends heavily on\nwhether the USMCA exemption holds, as is the case with the current 25% rate.\nMost Canada-US trade is USMCA-compliant and currently duty-free, so the real\neconomic costs could be quite small relative to overall trade. Sector-specific\ntariffs, such as the proposed 50% levy on copper, remain a separate threat, and\nwe think they could prove more durable than others to legal challenges.\n\nWith US equities at record highs, little evidence of economic fallout in US\ninflation or labor data, and his fiscal package having won approval from\nlawmakers, Trump appears emboldened to escalate trade actions. Reflecting this\nconfidence, Trump linked his renewed trade levies to rising equities, telling\nreporters “the tariffs have been very well received… the stock market hit a new\nhigh today.” The bond market impact has also been relatively contained in recent\nweeks, with 10-year US Treasury yields hovering near 4.34% and this week’s USD\n22bn Treasury auction of 30-year bonds fairly well received. However, this could\nchange as we get closer to actual enactment of these threats and executive\norders. A sharp sell-off in either stocks or bonds may be the catalyst needed to\nprompt a pause or reversal in tariff escalation.\n\nTrump’s push for “90 deals in 90 days” has fallen short, with only a Vietnam\nframework and a small UK deal reached so far. This is unsurprising, as trade\nnegotiations are inherently complex and time-consuming, requiring careful\ntechnical work and consensus-building over a period of months if not years. Many\ntrading partners remain cautious on striking a deal now, with looming\nsector-specific tariffs and ever-shifting US demands undercutting the prospects\nfor a durable agreement. We think Trump's latest tariff threats reflect a\nstrategy of creating headline risk to reassert leverage and accelerate stalled\nnegotiations. Although this has its limits and its own costs, we do expect more\ncountry-specific deals and frameworks in the coming weeks.\n\nSo, while negative trade headlines and tariff threats may multiply in the coming\nweeks, we think US trade policy will move toward greater stability in the second\nhalf of the year. Our base case is that the effective US tariff rate will land\nnear 15% by year-end, slowing the US economy over the next six months but not\ncausing a recession. Many of the most heavily weighted US equities in the S&P\n500 are fairly insulated from tariff risk, in our view, and we think the index\ncan climb to 6,500 by June next year despite periodic volatility. We recommend\nphasing into equities for underallocated investors to manage near-term market\nswings, or using structured strategies for more defensive positioning."}

We think it would be hard to justify the use of the International\nEmergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) given the trade surplus with Brazil.\nSections 232 and 301 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 are available to the US\npresident, but they would require an initial investigation and would have to be\nbased on a trade-related grievance. Given the possible legal hurdles, we think\nthe 50% threatened tariff on Brazil is unlikely to become permanent.\n\nWe reiterate our Attractive view on Brazil stocks, and believe that emerging\nmarket equities overall should continue to see solid performance amid a\nsupportive macro backdrop.\n\nBrazil is a relatively closed economy, with exports and imports accounting for\njust 28% of its GDP in 2024. Its largest trading partner is China, and only 16%\nof the country’s total exports go to the US, representing less than 2% of its\nGDP. While the 50% tariff would have a greater impact on certain products like\nsemi-manufactured iron and steel, aircraft, construction materials, ethanol, and\nwood and related products, we think the overall economic impact on the Brazilian\neconomy is manageable. We therefore expect the direct impact on corporate\nearnings to be contained.\n\nThe DXY index has fallen over 10% this year, and we believe the dollar weakness\nwill persist in the months to come. While minutes from the Federal Reserve’s\nJune meeting showed only narrow support for a near-term reduction in interest\nrates, “most participants” anticipated rate cuts would be appropriate later this\nyear. We expect 100 basis points of easing over the next 12 months, while the\nelevated fiscal deficit should also weigh on the greenback. A weaker US dollar\nhas historically been supportive of emerging market equities as it encourages\ncapital inflows and eases corporate debt burdens. It also clears the way for\nmore monetary policy easing in emerging markets, which should help stimulate\neconomic activity locally, encouraging investment and spending.\n\nAs investors seek to broaden their sources of return, emerging markets offer\naccess to unique macro and policy cycles, structural growth opportunities, and\ndiversification benefits—especially amid rising geopolitical fragmentation and\nshifting supply chains. Emerging market equities remain under-owned and have\nonly recently begun to attract inflows, which could support a more constructive\nmedium-term outlook for the asset class.\n\nSo, while we continue to highlight near-term volatility, we see decent\nmid-single-digit upside for emerging market equities over the next 12 months and\nmaintain our Neutral rating. We recommend a selective approach, favoring secular\ngrowth stories in Taiwan and India. We also like mainland China's tech sector\ndue to its resilient earnings and monetization potential, as well as Brazil\ngiven attractive valuations and solid economic growth.\n\nRead more in CIO's "}

Investor sentiment dipped slightly ahead of the US market\nopen, with S&P 500 futures down 0.1%, as the White House may send out more\ntariff letters later today.\n\nCurrent S&P 500 valuations suggest that investors have priced in a substantial\nde-escalation in trade frictions and geopolitical tensions, following the equity\nbenchmark’s nearly 26% rally since its post-“Liberation Day” low three months\nago. Tariff headlines in the coming days and weeks are likely to fuel\nvolatility, especially if the Trump administration starts to unveil more details\non sector-specific tariffs.\n\nBut we believe the US equity bull market still has room to run, and we expect\nfurther gains over the next 12 months.\n\nDeclines in policy uncertainty have historically been positive for stocks, and\nwe think US trade policy will move toward greater stability in the second half\nof the year. Decisions on sectoral tariffs and the legality of tariffs based on\nthe International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) may generate headlines\nand short-term volatility. But we expect country-specific deals and arrangements\nin the coming weeks, as the Trump administration fully recognizes the potential\nimpact that highly aggressive tariffs could have on the economy and financial\nmarkets. We note that sectoral and renewed “reciprocal” tariff threats could be\na way to gain negotiating leverage, and that the US would not want tariffs much\nhigher than current levels that would ultimately reduce trade and hence tariff\nrevenue.\n\nWe expect a 15% effective tariff rate to slow the US economy over the next six\nmonths, with real GDP growth estimated at below 1% quarter over quarter. But we\ndo not forecast a recession, and we expect economic expansion to recover to 1-2%\nquarter over quarter in 2026. The current level of job openings compared to\nunemployment remains healthy, and initial jobless claims remain at historically\nlow levels. Strong US consumer balance sheets and the adaptability of global\nsupply chains should also help cushion the blow. Additionally, the resumption of\nFederal Reserve policy easing later this year would be supportive of equities.\n\nWe forecast S&P 500 earnings per share (EPS) growth of just 4% in the second\nquarter as the reporting season approaches, down from 9% in the first quarter\nand 10% last year. But we also expect the upcoming results to show the\nresilience of corporate profits, while some provisions in the One Big Beautiful\nBill Act should boost near-term corporate cash flows. We expect quarterly\nearnings growth to recover to above 6% as we enter 2026, which should lift\nfull-year earnings growth to 8% next year from 6% this year. Historically,\nstocks rise when earnings growth expectations are positive.\n\nSo, we expect the S&P 500 to reach 6,500 by June next year, although the journey\nup is likely to be accompanied by periodic volatility. We recommend phasing into\nequities for underallocated investors to manage near-term market swings, or\nstructured strategies for more defensive positioning."}

Trump warned\nthat any retaliatory tariffs will trigger like-for-like US tariffs on top of the\nthreatened rate. The S&P 500 fell the most in three weeks, and the US dollar\nrose. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said more letters will be\nsent out in the coming days.\n\nHowever, Trump also signed an executive order on Monday extending the pause of\nthe “reciprocal” tariffs to 1 August, allowing more time for trade negotiations.\nHe added that the new deadline was “not 100% firm” and that the US remains open\nto further talks with countries offering additional concessions. Investor\nsentiment stabilized on Tuesday ahead of the US market open, with both Japan's\nNikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi posting gains, and S&P 500 futures flat.\nAsian currencies have also clawed back early losses.\n\nWe continue to expect various sector-specific tariffs to follow, including\nlevies targeting semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, copper, lumber, and critical\nminerals, and there remains significant uncertainty over the scope and shape of\nthese Section 232 tariffs. Market volatility is likely to pick up, but the\nlatest development does not constitute an escalation in the trade war, in our\nview.\n\nThe renewed threat that \"reciprocal\" tariffs could again rise higher toward the\n2 April levels suggests that far fewer bilateral agreements are materializing\nthan the Trump administration had hoped for at this stage. So far, the White\nHouse has signed just three handshake deals, well short of prior suggestions\nthat 90 deals could be completed in 90 days. The fact that new sectoral tariffs\nmight be imposed on countries even after an agreement is reached is likely part\nof the reason negotiations remain challenging. Given Trump’s\nescalate-to-de-escalate negotiating approach, the US administration may be\nlooking to gain additional leverage in talks with these latest numbers. However,\nthe move did not come as a surprise, with Trump reiterating his intention\nmultiple times in the past several weeks. The new tariff rates are also similar\nto the levels announced in early April, suggesting that the administration’s\npurpose is not to re-escalate trade tensions.\n\nWith Trump leaving the door open for additional negotiations and a new deadline,\nwe continue to expect country-specific deals and arrangements in the coming\nweeks. These could include a baseline tariff and selective quotas or exemptions\nfrom sectoral tariffs in exchange for purchase commitments or US investment\npledges. It is worth noting that the impact of “reciprocal” tariffs can be less\nthan the announced headline rate after taking the carveouts into consideration.\nAdditionally, notable trading partners like the EU and India did not receive a\nletter this round, suggesting that some deals could be in the making. Reuters\nreported that the EU is close to an agreement with the US that may include\nconcessions on aircraft, medical equipment, and alcohol, while Trump indicated\nhe US could soon make a deal with India. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also\nsaid over the weekend that several deals are close.\n\nWhile the US administration may choose to pursue elevated tariffs for more\nleverage, a prolonged period of higher levies would likely increase economic\ncosts and could bring political consequences for both Trump and the Republican\nParty ahead of the midterm elections next year. With the One Big Beautiful Bill\nAct (OBBBA) estimated to add USD 4.1tr to the US deficit over the next decade,\nwe think trade policies or threats that risk a recession will ultimately be\nnegotiated lower. Tariff revenues are needed to help offset spending provisions\nin the OBBBA, but excessively high tariffs could reduce trade, growth, and tax\nrevenues.\n\nSo, while tariffs will likely remain high—compared with levels at the start of\nthe year—as will the headline risk, we think the US effective tariff rate should\nend the year at around 15%. This would be a headwind to growth but not enough to\ntrigger a recession given the resilience of the US consumer and the adaptability\nof global supply chains. We continue to recommend phasing into global equities\nor diversified portfolios to navigate volatility ahead."}

The draft Commerce\nDepartment rule would target shipments from companies like NVIDIA, following\nconcerns over semiconductor smuggling, as well as Chinese access to AI compute\ncapacity based in Southeast Asia. Malaysia has quietly emerged as a key AI data\ncenter hub, accounting for nearly 12% of NVIDIA's global sales last quarter.\nNVIDIA's exposure to Thailand is less clear.\n\nThe US administration reportedly plans to introduce these new controls with the\nrollback of the more stringent “AI diffusion” export curb system introduced\nunder the previous administration. If it goes through, this would mark the first\nmajor round of AI regulation under the new Trump administration since it\nscrapped the Biden-era rules. A similar proposal, the AI Diffusion Act, was\nintroduced in January 2025 but later rescinded.\n\nWithout taking any single-name views, we make several observations for global\ninvestors with AI exposure:\n\nWhile the proposal appears relatively modest, we believe additional restrictions\non AI chip exports could act still as a near-term overhang for cyclical tech\nstocks. Regulatory signals leading up to this have been relatively\naccommodative, with the White House reining in the Biden-era tiered AI diffusion\nrules. The recent rally in global tech was driven more by price-to-earnings\nmultiple expansion than by positive earnings revisions, which suggests less room\nfor any misses in second-quarter results. The upcoming earnings season also\nmeans the market is now in its peak blackout period for share buybacks, where\ncompanies are unable to step in and support share prices in the event of any\ndeclines.\n\nThe proposal reportedly includes a key concession: American data center\noperators will still be allowed to import US AI chips. This suggests major US\nhyperscalers, such as Google and Microsoft, can continue their regional data\ncenter expansions without significant disruption. We believe Malaysian companies\nprimarily serving US-backed projects should remain relatively insulated from the\nnew export restrictions. In contrast, data center operators building facilities\nspeculatively or targeting Chinese demand may be more exposed to order\ncancelations or project delays.\n\nOur analysis shows that AI compute, including GPUs and custom AI chips, has\nattracted the strongest capital investment so far in 2025. This is reflected in\nrobust spending commitments from the Big 4, sovereign buyers (including those in\nthe Middle East), neoclouds, but also likely some China-linked demand. That\nsaid, the early April ban on H20 AI chip exports to China has already done much\nof the heavy lifting. We expect AI compute’s share of total AI capex to rise\nfrom approximately 53% in 2024 to about 59% in 2025. As investment broadens into\nareas like high-bandwidth memory, networking, and industrial AI infrastructure,\nwe anticipate AI compute’s share will later normalize toward 50-55% from 2026\nonward.\n\nAgainst a backdrop of new potential chip restrictions and a broadening out of AI\ntrends, we recommend investors adopt a balanced portfolio stance within tech and\nthe AI value chain. Recently, we shifted our preferences away from some of the\ncyclical AI-linked stocks that rallied in June, tilting instead toward select AI\nlaggards as well as internet and software stocks. Amid heightened volatility, we\nthink investors may also want to consider structured strategies to help navigate\nmarket swings. Beyond near-term risks, we believe the robust secular trends in\nAI will continue to drive long-term gains in the tech sector. Data center stocks\nin Southeast Asia may be more sensitive in the near term to headline risk and\npotential policy changes. Within Chinese equities, we believe the impact on\nlarge-cap tech shares should be manageable."}

Every Democrat and two Republicans\nopposed the measure. The razor-thin margin followed weeks of tense negotiations,\nwith party leaders able to afford only a handful of defections. Despite internal\ndisagreements over the scale of spending cuts and deficit impact, the\nlegislation advanced enough of the party’s core agenda to secure passage, paving\nthe way for a 4 July presidential signing ceremony.\n\nThe OBBB ushers in a new era of fiscal policy, combining steep spending\nreductions with even larger, mostly permanent, cuts to individual and corporate\ntaxes. The bill also introduces temporary tax exemptions for tips, overtime, and\nseniors; increases funding for border security and defense,; and cuts spending\non programs such as Medicaid, nutrition, clean energy, and student loans.\n\nWhile the legislation lifts the debt ceiling by USD 5 trillion, averting a\nnear-term fiscal showdown, it is projected to add trillions to the US debt load\nover the next decade.\n\nFinancial markets had largely anticipated the move, with equities and US\nTreasury yields showing relatively limited reaction; the S&P 500 rose 0.8% on\nThursday, while the 10-year Treasury yield rose 7 basis points, but these moves\nwere in part in reaction to a stronger-than-expected jobs report.\n\n\nThe passage of the OBBB marks a significant shift in the US fiscal outlook. The\nCommittee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that the bill will add USD\n4.1 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, or USD 5.5 trillion if all tax\ncut provisions are made permanent. The legislation not only raises the debt\nceiling by USD 5 trillion, but also locks in a higher debt path for years to\ncome. While the immediate risk of a fiscal standoff later this summer has been\naverted, we see clear long-term implications: The US will face a much larger\ndebt burden, with increased Treasury issuance likely required to fund persistent\ndeficits.\n\nThe deficit, as a share of GDP, is now projected to remain around 7% through the\nnext ten years—substantially higher than the Congressional Budget Office’s\nJanuary forecast, which anticipated a decline to 5.2% by 2027. This sustained\nfiscal gap reflects both the scale of the tax cuts and the challenges of\nenacting meaningful spending reductions. As a result, we believe the US fiscal\nposition will remain under pressure, with debt sustainability concerns likely to\npersist.\n\nA notable feature of the OBBB is the decision by Senate Republicans to use the\ncurrent policy baseline, rather than current law, for scoring the bill’s impact\non the deficit. This approach allowed lawmakers to avoid technical deficit\nincreases from extending existing tax cuts, effectively sidestepping the Byrd\nRule’s restrictions on reconciliation. If this method becomes standard practice,\nit could further erode legislative fiscal restraint, making it easier for future\nunified governments to enact large tax cuts without fully accounting for their\nlong-term fiscal impact. This move may set a precedent that could shape US\nfiscal policy for years to come.\n\n\nWhile the final details of the OBBB were only settled this week, markets had\nalready priced in much of the expected fiscal and economic impact. However, the\nlonger-term outlook is clouded by persistent deficits and higher Treasury\nsupply, which could put upward pressure on yields, particularly at the long end\nof the curve, where debt sustainability concerns are most acute.\n\nThe OBBB’s passage provides a modest fiscal boost for 2026, and the bill’s tax\ncuts and spending reforms may support earnings growth at the margin. The bill’s\npassage, alongside progress this week on trade deals, is aligned with our view\nthat the second half of the year will bring improved clarity on US policy,\nhelping lay the groundwork for equity market gains in 2026. Investors who are\nunder-allocated to equities should consider gradually increasing exposure to\ndiversified global stocks or balanced portfolios to position for future gains.\n\nIn fixed income, US Treasury yields have declined over the past month even as\nthe larger-than-expected future Treasury supply became apparent. We expect the\ndeficit to be funded through increased short-end supply, especially Treasury\nbills. The 30-year yield has declined the least after rising more than other\npoints on the curve, reflecting the sensitivity of long-end yields to debt\nsustainability concerns. We favor high-quality investment grade bonds in the\nintermediate area of the yield curve as they offer attractive risk-return\nprofiles and historically attractive yields.\n\nSustained deficits near 7% of GDP and a rising debt load are likely to weigh on\nthe US dollar over time. We would reduce excess US dollar cash and diversify\ninto other major currencies such as the euro and Australian dollar.\nInternational investors should review their strategic currency allocations and\nconsider hedging US dollar exposure in US assets back into their home\ncurrencies, as fiscal concerns may drive further dollar weakness.\n\nThe OBBB’s potential precedent-setting approach to fiscal scoring and deficit\nexpansion increases the risk of future policy shifts and market volatility. We\ncontinue to see gold as a valuable long-term portfolio diversifier, supported by\nongoing fiscal and geopolitical risks, central bank demand, and the prospect of\ndeclining real interest rates. We maintain our USD 3,500/oz year-end target,\nversus USD 3,343 at the close of trading on Thursday. We recommend a\nmid-single-digit allocation to gold, alongside alternatives like hedge funds and\ncapital preservation strategies on equities."}

The deal, which stemmed from direct talks with\nVietnamese General Secretary Tô Lâm, is said to impose a 20% tariff on\nVietnamese exports to the US, and a higher 40% levy on goods deemed to be\ntransshipped through the country. Trump said that Vietnam had agreed to drop all\nlevies on US imports in return.\n\nVietnam's state media on Thursday said President Trump has been invited for a\nstate visit to Vietnam, and that tariffs on several Vietnamese products would be\nsignificantly cut. No formal trade text has been publicly released, and it’s not\nclear how the transshipment provision (aimed largely at products rerouting from\nChina) would be implemented and enforced. In early April, Trump had imposed a\n46% duty on Vietnam as part of his initial rollout of the “reciprocal” tariffs,\nbefore pausing at a 10% level for negotiations.\n\nThe benchmark Vietnamese equity index fell 0.2% on Thursday, and regional\nmarkets in Asia were mixed. While we await more concrete details, we make\nseveral initial observations for global investors:\n\nThe draft Vietnam deal confirms that countries with sustained high trade\nsurpluses with the US, and those acting as transshipment hubs for Chinese goods,\nmay face higher baseline tariffs and additional duties on rerouted products. It\nalso confirms a broader US effort to ring-fence and curb perceived Chinese\noverproduction and excess capacity. In April, we warned of higher risks to\nVietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand over transshipments. It’s difficult to calculate\naccurately and estimates vary, but Nomura data suggest nearly 19% of Vietnam’s\nUS goods exports reflect Chinese value added, with Malaysia and Thailand next in\nline at 11.5% and 9.8%, respectively. We anticipate the economic pain will be\nfar more significant for Vietnam than China, given this represents a minimal\nfraction of China’s overall exports. Still, heavier penalties for transshippers\nshould further accelerate supply chain shifts out of China, as US companies\nstill need to source products competitively from compliant nations, in our view.\nWe would caveat that not all Asian economies fall in this transshipment bucket,\nwith North Asia, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Singapore less at risk.\n\nWhile Vietnam’s higher headline tariffs may appear to signal tougher outcomes\nelsewhere, we don’t see them as a template for other US trade talks. Vietnam is\namong the top 10 largest US trade partners, but less central than others now\nnegotiating. It’s also worth noting that our forecast for an overall US\neffective tariff rate of 15% assumes a 30-40% rate on Chinese exports in\nparticular. Despite the Vietnam deal’s indirect targeting of China, we note\npositive US-China steps this week on chip design software, ethane, and rare\nearths, and that there is plenty of time to reach a deal before the 90-day\nreciprocal tariff pause on China ends on 12 August. The US’s top two trade\npartners, Mexico and Canada, are on a separate track and are not subject to the\n10% baseline or “reciprocal” tariffs. Both have made progress on border issues,\nand we think they could ultimately agree to metal quotas and to limits on\nChinese transshipments. Overall, when factoring in sector-specific tariffs,\npotential carveouts, and some one-off less punitive bilateral deals, we think\nour year-end forecast for a 15% US effective tariff rate remains reasonable.\n\nWith the 9 July “reciprocal” tariff pause deadline looming, we expect the US\nadministration to announce several country-specific deals and further extensions\nfor countries negotiating \"in good faith,\" as well as bilateral escalations\naimed at strengthening US negotiating leverage. Following the Vietnam\nannouncement, Reuters reports Indian and US negotiators are pushing to land a\ndeal this week, with some officials reportedly told to be on standby for a\npotential announcement. Japan and South Korea have expressed more difficulty in\ntalks in public comments, but neither is walking away and could be granted\nextensions, in our view. We also note that purchase agreements have proven\npopular with the US administration.\n\nSo, on balance, we take the US-Vietnam accord as a positive step toward more\ndurable bilateral deals for the US and toward greater clarity for investors.\nWhile tariffs will likely slow US growth and add some inflation pressure into\n2026, we do not expect them to derail the economy or cause a recession. Headline\nrisks around trade may persist as negotiations continue, but we think the market\nimpact should moderate as President Trump’s negotiating tactics become\nincreasingly familiar. Ultimately, we expect the US administration to prioritize\neconomic stability over more maximalist tariffs, especially ahead of the 2026\nmidterm elections. After the current round of “reciprocal” tariff negotiations,\nwe think the next major milestone will likely be the announcement of\nsector-specific tariffs under Section 232 on pharma, semiconductors, and\ncritical minerals later this year. We continue to recommend gradually increasing\nexposure to diversified global stocks or balanced portfolios to position for\nstronger potential returns in 2026 and beyond."}

The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) in the Senate\nhas also put US fiscal worries under the spotlight. The yield on the 10-year\nTreasury has climbed to 4.28% at the time of writing, around 5 basis points\nhigher than it was early Tuesday.\n\nJob openings in May rose to the highest level since November 2024, according to\nthe latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, while layoffs have fallen.\nThe quits rate, a key indicator of worker confidence, also edged up from a month\nearlier. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday reiterated that the US\ncentral bank plans to wait for more data before lowering interest rates.\n\nSeparately, the version of the OBBBA passed by the Senate overnight would raise\nthe debt ceiling by USD 5tr, more than the USD 4tr approved by the House last\nmonth. The bill now goes back to the House for a final vote before US President\nDonald Trump signs it into law.\n\nBut while US deficits are set to increase over the coming years, we do not\nexpect a sustained Treasury sell-off. We believe the recent declines in bond\nyields will continue over the remainder of the year.\n\nA key investor concern behind the sharp rise in the long end of the yield curve\nearlier this year was the prospect of a ballooning supply of long-dated Treasury\nbonds needed to finance the growing federal debt. But recent auctions have shown\na stabilization in investor sentiment. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent earlier\nthis week also indicated that his department is unlikely to ramp up sales of\nlonger-term securities given where yields are now. Instead, we expect more\nshort-term Treasuries, such as T-bills, will be issued until the Fed resumes\npolicy easing later this year.\n\nThe outcome of the pending House vote on the OBBBA remains uncertain, though we\nexpect the bill will ultimately pass. Several House Republicans have said they\ndo not support the Senate version, which the nonpartisan Congressional Budget\nOffice estimates will add USD 800bn more to the national debt than the initial\nHouse version over the coming decade. But we think the US remains able to manage\nits debt. The Fed’s credibility, the US dollar’s reserve status, deep and liquid\nTreasury markets, Fed balance sheet holdings, and bank capital regulations could\nall help finance the deficit.\n\nWhile job openings rose in May, hiring momentum has slowed, suggesting\nbusinesses are cautious about long-term hiring plans as trade and economic\nheadwinds persist. As markets look to the June labor report due tomorrow, we\nexpect payroll growth to slow soon as the impact of policy shifts becomes more\napparent. The ISM Manufacturing PMI for June signaled that US factory activity\nhas contracted for a fourth consecutive month. Our base case remains that the\nFed would resume easing in September, bringing interest rates 100 basis points\nlower over the next 12 months as growth slows.\n\nSo, we continue to think high-quality government and investment grade corporate\nbonds offer attractive risk-reward for investors seeking durable portfolio\nincome. Long-term investors can also consider diversified fixed income\nstrategies."}

Valuations have also returned to near last year’s high, raising\ninvestor concerns over the sustainability of the rally, when margins are set to\nmoderate amid strong investment commitments.\n\nThe structural outperformance of tech stocks versus the broader market over the\npast two decades has partly been due to the sector’s strong margins. But the\nsignificant upfront investments required in artificial intelligence (AI) compute\nand related infrastructure mean that tech companies’ near-term margins are\nlikely to come under pressure. The capex intensity (capex divided by revenues)\nof the Big Four tech firms has increased from 11.5% in 2020 to nearly 21% in\n2025, and we estimate it will stay elevated at around 22% through to 2030.\n\nBut while we continue to expect near-term volatility amid macro uncertainty, we\nbelieve any moderation in tech margins will be temporary, and that encouraging\nAI monetization trends should underpin the sector’s growth trajectory.\n\nWhile we expect a dip in big tech’s margins this year and next, we believe they\nshould recover in the years to come as AI automation drives other operating\ncosts lower in the longer term. Tech companies have already highlighted how AI\nhas automated key tasks like coding, content generation, office productivity,\nand marketing, so we expect the majority of operating costs to increase at a\nslower pace than total revenue growth over the next five years. Accelerating\nautomation or stronger monetization could see a faster margin recovery amid\nefficiency gains.\n\nThe latest US Census Bureau survey showed that AI adoption across 1.2 million\nfirms in the US has risen further in the June quarter, with some industries\nreporting adoption rates of 25-30%. As more tangible use cases gather pace\nacross industries, we believe overall AI adoption will continue to rise, driving\nfurther monetization for software and internet companies. Oracle, for example,\nhas recently signed a single cloud deal worth USD 30bn in annual revenue, more\nthan the current size of its entire cloud infrastructure business.\n\nWe expect the Federal Reserve to resume policy easing later this year as US\neconomic activity slows. With 100 basis points of rate cuts expected over the\nnext 12 months, US dollar weakness is likely to persist. Such a backdrop should\nbe supportive for tech stocks, as overseas sales account for over 50% of US tech\ncompanies’ revenue, while lower rates make future earnings more valuable when\ndiscounted back to the present. We expect global tech earnings to grow 12% this\nyear.\n\nSo, while near-term risks remain, we believe the robust secular trend of AI will\ncontinue to drive the longer-term gains in the tech sector. We favor a balanced\nand diversified positioning across the AI value chain, and recommend investors\nconsider structured strategies to navigate volatility ahead."}

The S&P\n500 on Friday notched its first record since February this year, while the MSCI\nAll Country World index has rallied 3.3% over the past week.\n\nTrade headlines are moving fast. Canada on Sunday night scrapped its digital\nservices tax targeting US tech firms, just hours before it was due to take\neffect, after US President Donald Trump on Friday said he was terminating trade\ntalks with Canada and threatened to set a new tariff. Following the move to drop\nthe tax, Canada’s finance ministry said the two neighbors will resume trade\nnegotiations in order to agree on a deal by 21 July.\n\nSuch fresh twists and turns look set to dominate the final days before 9 July,\npotentially injecting volatility into markets that are eager for clarity over US\ntrade policy. But we think near-term swings are unlikely to materially alter the\nlonger-term market trajectory.\n\nTrump has demonstrated a willingness to shock the market with tariff demands\nthat he later modifies. He may choose to do this again in a bid to entice\nquicker agreements. We think the deadline is likely to pass without major\nescalation, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicating a potential\nextension of the tariff pause for countries engaged in “good-faith\nnegotiations.” In recent days, Japan and India extended their trade negotiators’\nstay in Washington in hopes of reaching separate tariff agreements, while\nFrance’s finance minister praised progress in EU-US negotiations.\n\nSenate Republicans over the weekend pushed through Trump’s sweeping tax cut and\nspending bill, with a vote on a long list of amendments to the One Big Beautiful\nBill Act scheduled for today. An estimate by the non-partisan Congressional\nBudget Office suggests that the bill would add USD 3.3tr to the nation’s debt\nover a decade, about USD 800bn more than the version passed last month in the\nHouse of Representatives. While the US fiscal deficit is likely to remain\nelevated, it also increases the administration’s incentive to keep economic\ngrowth on track to manage and improve the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio. This\nmeans trade policies or threats that risk a recession are likely to be\nnegotiated lower, as it is not in the Trump administration’s interest to have\ntariffs so high that they reduce trade, growth, and tax revenues.\n\nWe expect the US administration to pursue alternative legal avenues (including\nproduct-specific tariffs) if the courts ultimately rule against the\nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) as the basis for tariffs,\nkeeping the eventual effective size and scope of tariffs largely similar to\ncurrent levels. While this means the US effective tariff rate would represent\nthe highest levels since the 1930s, it would still be much lower than what was\nannounced in early April. Given the resilience of the US consumer and the\nadaptability of global supply chains, we believe a 15% effective tariff rate is\nunlikely to trigger a recession despite being a headwind to growth and a modest\nboost to inflation.\n\nSo, while tariff headlines could periodically unsettle markets, we do not\ncurrently see them as a catalyst for a sustained market sell-off. For investors\nunder-allocated to broad equity markets, we recommend gradually increasing\nexposure to diversified global stocks or balanced portfolios to position for\nstronger potential returns in 2026 and beyond."}

It’s been only a week since the White\nHouse said it would impose a 30% tariff on goods from Mexico and the European\nUnion—following a flurry of proposed new levies on a range of nations. (See our\nmost recent CIO Alert:.) This week EU envoys are meeting to discuss how to\nrespond in the event that no deal is reached with the US.\n\nWith the new deadline for implementation from the White House just over a week\naway—on 1 August—investors will be hoping for reassurance that the president’s\ntrade announcements have been a negotiating tactic to extract better terms from\npartners. Such reassurance could come from the announcement of further trade\nagreements—including one with India, which Trump said late last week was “very\nclose” to being finalized. Investors will also be hoping for progress in talks\nwith the EU.\n\nOur view remains that the US tariffs will settle well below some of the elevated\nlevels suggested by the president in public. By the end of the year, our base\ncase is for the effective US tariff rate to settle around 15% —a level that,\nwhile a drag on growth, would not tip the US economy into recession, in our\nview. However, markets already appear to be pricing in a benign outcome on\ntrade, so the rally could be vulnerable to more brinkmanship from Trump. That\nhas the potential to cause renewed market volatility in the near term. But we\nstill expect equities to move higher over the next 12 months as US policy\nuncertainty fades, the Federal Reserve likely cut rates, and structural growth\nthemes like artificial intelligence continue to advance. We view phasing into\nmarkets as an effective way to position for potential gains into 2026.\n\nTensions between President Trump and Fed Chair Jerome Powell intensified again\nlast week, raising questions about the independence of the central bank. (Read\nour House View Daily: ) The president, who has been critical of the Fed’s\nreluctance to cut rates this year, challenged the cost of recent renovations to\nthe central bank’s headquarters. There were also reports that the president had\ndiscussed dismissing Powell with Republican lawmakers. While the president later\nsaid it was “highly unlikely” that he would seek to fire Powell, he indicated\nthat he “didn’t rule anything out.”\n\nSuch headlines did generate some ripples in markets last week, contributing to\nan initial move into defensive assets such as gold while weakening the US\ndollar. Investors this week will be hoping that the dispute fades. Our view has\nbeen that the president would be unlikely to risk a direct challenge to Fed\nautonomy, with any move to dismiss Powell likely facing legal challenges. And\nfinally, the fact that the chair of the Fed is just one of 12 voting\npolicymakers means that switching out Powell would not necessarily lead to a\nswifter reduction in rates.\n\nOur view is that Fed policy will continue to be driven primarily by labor market\nand inflation data. Our base case is that this will lead to 100 basis points of\neasing over the coming 12 months, most likely starting at the September policy\nmeeting. As rates fall, we see value in focusing on more durable sources of\nincome, particularly through allocations to high grade and investment grade\nbonds.\n\n\nThe tech sector has once again been the main engine of a broader equity rally.\nThe Nasdaq hit fresh record highs last week, and AI chipmaker NVIDIA\nconsolidated its position as the world's first USD 4 trillion company. But much\nof the latest leg of the tech rally has been due to rising multiples. Investors\nwill now want to see this supported by earnings growth and capital spending\nplans. Last week the tech sector reporting season got off to a mixed start—with\nrecord profits from chipmaker TSMC but more disappointing results from\ncapital-equipment maker ASML. (Read our House View Daily: )\n\nThis week we get results from some of the biggest US tech firms— including\nAlphabet, where investors will be looking for guidance on AI investment plans as\nwell as progress in monetizing AI. Among the so-called Magnificent 7, we also\nget results from EV automaker Tesla.\n\nWe go into the earnings season expecting healthy results and encouraging\nguidance from tech, supporting our bullish long-term view on AI. Overall, we are\nexpecting 12% profit growth from global tech in 2025 along with strong capital\nspending. However, after such a swift rally we recommend investors avoid\nconcentrated risk in a single segment of tech or a single stock, opting instead\nfor a well diversified exposure across semiconductor, software, and internet\nplatforms.\n\nUS consumer price inflation ticked up in June, rising by 2.7% year-overyear, as\nthe impact of tariffs gradually fed into the economy. Core goods inflation,\nexcluding volatile food and energy prices, rose to a two-year high in June, led\nby a rise in prices across tariff-sensitive categories such as consumer\nappliances, reflecting the pass-through of tariff costs to consumers.\nNevertheless, we expect only a modest acceleration in inflation from here, given\nour base case for overall US effective tariff rates to land at around 15%. With\ncore services inflation expected to slow further, this should also help to\noffset the rise in overall inflation led by tariffs. Therefore, we maintain\nour view for the Fed to resume rate cuts in September, bringing policy rates\ndown 100 basis points by June 2026.\n\nTariff impact revealed beneath headline inflation\nUS headline, core, commodities ex-food and energy (core goods), services\nex-energy (core services) CPI, y/y %"}

Over the past six months, investors have contended with shifting\npolicy, swings in sentiment, and geopolitical events. Yet, beneath the surface,\nthe outlines of a more constructive environment are forming.\n\nWe see five key factors that we expect to drive investment outcomes in the\nmonths ahead:\n\nFirst, US trade and fiscal policies are gradually taking shape. While the\nexpiration of the US “reciprocal” tariff pause and legal debates around the\nbasis for tariffs risk near-term volatility, we expect the final contours of US\ntrade policy to become clearer in the weeks ahead. Meanwhile, Treasury and\nlegislative actions, including the likely passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill\nAct, should provide greater clarity on fiscal policy. Elevated tariffs and\npersistent deficits may periodically unsettle markets, but we do not expect them\nto end the broader economic expansion or trigger a sustained market drawdown.\n\nSecond, geopolitical risk remains a feature of the current environment. Ongoing\nconflicts in the Middle East and Eastern Europe pose tail risks. The challenge\nfor investors is how to effectively diversify and hedge the risk of further\nescalation.\n\nThird, we expect interest rates and bond yields to fall. The Federal Reserve has\nbeen on hold all year, but we expect it to resume cutting in the second half. We\nbelieve lower rates, lower growth, slower inflation, and “safe-haven” flows will\nlead to lower high grade bond yields by year-end.\n\nFourth, we expect further US dollar weakness. After a significant decline in the\nfirst half, the pace of further depreciation may moderate, but we expect the\nlonger-term trend of “de-dollarization” to persist.\n\nFinally, we believe structural growth trends—particularly artificial\nintelligence, power and resources, and longevity—will continue to drive equity\nmarket returns, supported by further innovation, adoption, and monetization in\nthe second half and beyond.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, we recommend that investors align portfolios with these\nkey drivers while managing the risk of renewed volatility.\n\nFor those underallocated to equities, progressively increasing exposure to\ndiversified global stocks or balanced portfolios can help position for stronger\npotential returns in the years ahead.\n\nWe also recommend deploying cash into quality bonds and diversified income\nstrategies, which can help enhance yield and improve income durability, and\nconsidering hedges or diversification to reduce excess dollar holdings.\n\nFinally, we view gold as an effective hedge against geopolitical risks, while\nhedge funds and private markets can provide alternative sources of portfolio\nreturns.\n\nFor more details read the CIO Monthly Letter\n\nAlso see our: 2H outlook:\n\n\n\n(3:16)\n(5:50)\n(5:02)\n\n Two key deadlines are approaching. First, President Trump is pushing to get the\nOne Big Beautiful Bill Act over the finish line before the Independence Day\nholiday on 4 July. The second deadline is the expiration of the 90- day tariff\npause, just over a week away at the time of writing. Investors will be hoping\nfor renewed progress on trade relations in the coming days. Regarding US fiscal\npolicy, markets seem to be resigned to a bill that expands US debt over the\ncoming decade.\n\nThe US had been scheduled to hold talks with Iran over a more lasting solution\nto its conflict with Iran. After an exchange of hostile rhetoric late last week\nbetween the leaders of the two nations, the outlook remains unclear. Investors\nwill be hoping for signs that diplomatic efforts can resume, lowering\ngeopolitical risks.\n\nFed officials sent mixed signals last week on the timing of potential rate\ncuts. Governor Bowman suggested that easing could come sooner than expected,\nwhile Chair Powell emphasized the need for patience, indicating the Fed may wait\nfor more evidence before acting. This week, investors’ focus will turn to key\neconomic data releases—including nonfarm payrolls, ISM data, and JOLTS job\nvacancy figures— to see if these numbers could tilt the Fed toward an earlier\ncut or reinforce Powell’s call for patience."}
