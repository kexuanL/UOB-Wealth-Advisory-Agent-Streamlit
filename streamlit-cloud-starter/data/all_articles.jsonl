Goldman Sachs Research analysts now assess the current\nemployment status of women in India and explore opportunities that lie ahead.\nWhile India benefits from favorable demographics, it will not reap the full\nbenefits unless women become a larger part of its labor force. The female labor\nforce participation rate in India is significantly below the male participation\nrate and also below these rates in other major economies. One of the key reasons\nfor women's low participation in the labor force is that the women in India bear\na disproportionate responsibility for domestic and care-giving activities.\nIndian women spend ~8x more time on a daily basis in domestic and care-giving\nservices than men. However, an encouraging development over the past few years\nhas been the rise of self-employed women in India. Women in corporate India are\nunder-represented but gradually gaining ground. Going forward, our analysts find\nthat building a robust ‘care economy’ (a network of child care centers and elder\ncare ecosystem) would (a) free up women’s time for paid employment opportunities\nelsewhere, and (b) create greater employment opportunities for the 'care work'\nservices sector."}

While it is important\nnot to understate the challenges still facing the Continent, especially as\nconflict continues both on the Continent and in the Middle East, that negativity\nhas undergone a remarkable reversal.\n\nAs I convene our Board of Directors in Paris this week, it’s clear to us that\nthis nascent optimism presents an opportunity. European nations are making\nmeaningful strides towards a more cohesive defence policy, and the Continent\nwould also benefit from making more cohesive economic and financial\nstrides—especially by reducing cross-border frictions and harnessing the power\nof a more integrated capital market and banking union.\n\nI see reasons to be encouraged that Europe can make progress. \n\nEU leaders clearly recognise that greater autonomy in the realm of defence and\nsecurity is both a strategic and economic imperative.\n\nFirst, the agreement of a new spending target among NATO members, and the\nhistoric shift in Germany’s positioning earlier this year, is testament to a\nfundamental change in mindset. As defence expenditures accelerate, the Eurozone\nis forecast to grow at a faster rate than predicted just a few months ago, with\nthis fiscal expansion as a tailwind.\n\nTo be clear, prolonged war benefits no one. We are hopeful for swift and\npeaceful resolutions to the current conflicts.   \n\nSecond, Europe retains important strengths. While international investors would\nlike to see faster action, reforms in recent years by individual countries have\nimproved tax regimes to attract talent and Europe remains one of the richest and\nlargest economies in the world.\n\nOur experience is a case in point. Over the last few years, Goldman Sachs has\nsignificantly scaled up our operations across Europe—from Warsaw to Frankfurt,\nand Milan to The Hague. Here in Paris, we opened a new office to accommodate our\ngrowing footprint, with almost 500 positions now on the ground and all our\nbusiness lines represented in the city. This would not have been possible\nwithout the positive reform agenda in France.\n\nFinally, Europe benefits from a rich talent pool. Its schools and universities,\nespecially for business and engineering, are globally competitive. It does not\nlack for hungry and driven young professionals who are the foundation of firms\nlike ours.\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde and European Commission President Ursula von der\nLeyen have recently made the same point: Per million inhabitants, the EU\nproduces almost as many science, technology, engineering, and mathematics\ngraduates as the US.\n\nThe open question is why these strengths have not translated to the same level\nof economic and entrepreneurial dynamism as in the United States.\n\nI believe Europe can achieve economic dynamism, but only if more decisive\nactions are taken to unlock the full potential of the European market. These\nactions will require popular and political will, but there is reason to expect\nEurope can surmount the obstacles.\n\nI offer five key suggestions as Europe seeks to reform its economy for a new\nera.\n\nFirst, Europe should be clear-eyed about the burdens its regulatory environment\ncurrently places on business. I see it at Goldman Sachs and hear it from the\nCEOs I speak to around the world: Europe remains an outlier in terms of the\nextensive—often overbearing, duplicative, and costly—obligations it places on\nfirms. Mario Draghi put this in stark terms: Europe’s internal barriers and\nregulatory hurdles are equivalent to a tariff of 110% for services and 45% for\nmanufacturing.\n\nI would encourage EU policymakers to look at the regulatory infrastructure that\nhas mushroomed over the years in Brussels. Reducing or eliminating unwieldy and\nineffective structures and processes will send a loud message that the EU is\nfocused on efficiency, results, and economic growth. \n\nAs such, we warmly welcome the focus from the new European Commission, as well\nas leaders like President Macron and Chancellor Merz, on an ambitious programme\nof regulatory and administrative simplification. From our perspective, the scale\nof the challenge calls for a bold rethink, not tinkering around the edges.\n\nThe aim of reducing reporting burdens on business by 25% is a helpful north\nstar. But meeting it will require both a different and detailed approach. The\nindustry is eager to have a dialogue about how to focus reporting on information\nthat is genuinely useful to authorities. \n\nSecond, member states need to play their part in building the pools of long-term\ncapital needed to channel financing more forcefully into both public and private\nmarkets—where much of the economic activity in Europe is now happening. Plugging\ngaps in auto-enrolment, consolidating pension schemes, and introducing\ncompelling incentives for retail participation in capital markets are key steps\nto take without undue delay.\n\nA fundamental prerequisite of a Europe-wide ‘Savings & Investments Union’ is a\nstrong capital market underpinned by robust engagement from institutional and\nretail investors. Europe is building on solid foundations in this respect, with\nan internationally regarded equity market structure that has seen it weather\nrecent episodes of volatility effectively.\n\nThird, special attention must be paid to Europe’s venture and growth capital\necosystem. This means freeing up pension funds and insurers to engage more with\nearly-stage investments while looking at the scope for public funding to\n“de-risk” potential projects. America’s enormous advantage in the availability\nof early-stage risk capital is among its most important distinguishing features.\n\nEurope must offer greater support for small businesses to engage investors and\nsimplify the cross-border regulatory regime they face. \n\nFourth, it’s time for the EU to demonstrate a more serious commitment to its now\ndecade-old pledge of creating a unified capital market. Any moves toward\nintegration will allow more companies to diversity their funding, facilitate\ncross-border investment, and catalyse the risk-taking necessary for the\ninnovation needed to better compete in the global economy.\n\nThe final piece is naturally the most challenging: How does Europe work\ncollectively to put its interests first when one or two countries veto reform in\norder to protect their narrow parochial interests? I know this question goes\nback to the beginning of the EU. But decades of experience and evidence make it\nclear today: The focus on national interests over EU-wide interests is\nthrottling the economic, financial, diplomatic, and military power of the\nregion—the opposite of the goals of the EU founders.\n\nNow is the time to translate ideas into tangible change. As I said earlier, the\nopportunity is there for the taking. Greater independence in an uncertain\ngeopolitical landscape, nurturing world-leading innovative firms, and offering\ncitizens the opportunity to benefit themselves through a true investment union,\nare major prizes.\n\nMy hope is for Europe to succeed in this endeavour. In a fragmented and\nincreasingly volatile world, a self-reliant and dynamic Europe benefits us all. "}

So, what will global aging mean\nfor our economic future? I'm Allison Nathan and this is\nGoldman Sachs Exchanges.\nToday I'm sitting down with my colleague, Kevin Daly, co-\nhead of the Economics team covering Central and Eastern\nEurope, the Middle East, and Africa within Global Macro\nResearch. Kevin, welcome back to Exchanges.\nKevin Daly: Thank you very much, Allison. Good to see\n\n2\nyou.\nAllison Nathan: So, Kevin, you've done a lot of work\naround your path to 2075 Series looking at what the global\neconomy could look like 50 years from now. And you\nrecently released a report about global aging. It's no secret\nthat the global population is aging. But first, give us the\nfacts behind that. What measure do you look at to\ndetermine this? And what does it show?\nKevin Daly: Allison, however you measure it, the global\npopulation is aging. So, if you look at the median ages in\ndeveloped economies, 50 years ago the median age was 30.\nNow it's 43. Over the next 50 years, that's expected to rise\nto 47. For emerging economies, they're significantly\nyounger. But the median age there has also risen from 19\nto 30 currently. And it's projected to rise to 40 over the\nnext 50 years.\nThe other way that economists like to look at it is to look at\ndevelopments in the working age ratio. So, what is the\nshare of the population that is between the ages of 15 to\n64? For developed economies, that peaked just before the\nturn of the century, around 67 percent. It's currently at 63\n\n3\npercent and is projected, over the next 50 years, to fall to\n57 percent. So, however you cut it, the global population is\naging.\nAllison Nathan: So, what's driving that process of\npopulation aging?\nKevin Daly: I mean, there are two developments. There's\nincreased longevity and declining fertility. On increased\nlongevity, life expectancy has risen in the what\ndemographers call the longevity frontier. So, this is the\ncountry with the highest longevity in the world. 100 years\nago, that was Australia. And the life expectancy was 63. 50\nyears ago, that country was Iceland with a life expectancy\nof 75. Currently, the country with the highest life\nexpectancy in the world is Hong Kong with 86 years.\nIf you look at that trend, over time that's rising very\nsteadily. And for 150 years has been rising steadily at a\nrate of about a quarter of a year every year. If you look at\nthe global economy as a whole, actually it's been rising\neven faster than that because there's been some\nconvergence to the frontier. So, countries with the lowest\nlife expectancies have seen the biggest increases. So, on\n\n4\naverage, it's risen by about a third of a year every year. So,\nthat longevity is contributing to population aging.\nThe other factor, as I said, is fertility. So, fertility has fallen\npretty significantly globally. It peaked at 5.4 in 1963. So,\nthat's total fertility per woman. And is now fallen to 2.1. In\ndeveloped economies, it's actually significantly lower than\nthat at 1.5. In emerging economies it's at 2.2.\nAllison Nathan: So, let's take those in turn. First of all,\nlongevity. Isn't it a good thing that we are living longer?\nWe're all striving to live longer. In some ways that is the\nproduct of innovation and technological advancement and\neverything else, is to be able to live longer.\nKevin Daly: It's a very basic point. But it's a very good\none. And it's one that I think a lot of economists often miss.\nIs that the fact that we're living longer, and not only longer,\nbut also healthier lives, is a fantastic testament to the\nscientific progress that we have made over the last couple\nof centuries. And as I say, it's not just that we're living\nlonger, we're also living healthier lives as well. There was a\nvery comprehensive study done by the IMF recently\npublished which looked at 50-year-olds over the last\n\n5\nquarter of a century. And it found that on average,\nsomebody who's 70 today has the same cognitive abilities\nas somebody who was 53 in the year 2000. 25 years ago.\nWhen you look at physical ability, somebody who is 70\ntoday has the same physical abilities as somebody who was\n56 in the year 2000. In a very real and tangible sense, 70 is\nthe new 53. So, this is a fantastic benefit for us.\nAllison Nathan: That's really striking, actually. Even in\nthe year 2000, which is very fresh in our memories, that we\nhave had such a big improvement. Very interesting.\nKevin Daly: I know. People are sometimes surprised at\nthat. But if you look at the TV shows from the 1980s, from\nthe 1990s, you look at some of these actors or even sports\nstars from that period and you take pictures of these\npeople and you go, you know, that actor was in his 30s\nwhen he was doing that role. And often these people are\npeople who today would pass for somebody in their 40s or\ntheir 50s. So, it is however you measure it, both physically,\nboth mentally, how people look, we are living significantly\nlonger and healthier lives.\n\n6\nAllison Nathan: And so, we are seeing a big rise in life\nexpectancy.\nKevin Daly: We are. And actually, the official data, I\nthink, are understanding the true increase in life\nexpectancy because life expectancy data that are commonly\nquoted are actually not really a measure of life expectancy\nin the true sense, they're a measure of what are the age of\npeople dying at today. So, when we say in an average\ndeveloped economy life expectancy is 82 years old, what\nwe're saying in effect is that somebody born 82 years ago in\nthe 1940s would live to 82.\nNow the measure, the official life expectancy in the 1940s\nwas actually in the 61,62. So, if somebody's born today,\ntheir true life expectancy is only 82 if we assume that there\nisn't some improvement in mortality rates and longevity\nrates over the coming 82 years.\nAllison Nathan: And in that context, Kevin, when you say\nmortality rates, how do you define that?\nKevin Daly: Mortality rates can be defined many different\nways. But it is the average number of people in a\n\n7\npopulation. And often that's defined under a specific age\ncategory. So, how many 20-year-olds are dying? How many\n30-year-olds are dying in a specific year? And what we're\nseeing, what is driving the increases in life expectancy is\nthat there've been reduced numbers of deaths or\nmortalities for every age group going up until now into the\neighties and nineties.\nAllison Nathan: And so, the assumption that mortality\nrates will remain constant is not bearing out. You're\nactually seeing mortality rates-- less death.\nKevin Daly: Not only is it not bearing out now, but it\nhasn't born out for the past 150 years. Now, that's not true\nfor every country. There are some countries where you are\nseeing, actually, the life expectancy is declining. In the US,\nfor instance, since COVID, there has been a decline in life\nexpectancy. So, it's not good news everywhere in every\ncountry. But on average across the world, there's been this\nconsistent increase in life expectancy that has been taking\nplace for more than 150 years.\nAllison Nathan: Let's talk about the other factor you\nmentioned, declining fertility. How worried should we be\n\n8\nabout that?\nKevin Daly: It's clear that this isn't an unambiguous\npositive in the way that increased longevity will be. I'm long\nenough in this business to remember until a few years ago\nthat people were really worried about exploding population\ngrowth and very excessively rapid population growth. And\nwe have to remind ourselves that even with the falls in\nfertility we have had, is that the global population is still\nprojected to continue to rise.\nSo, the UN on its latest projections expect global\npopulation to rise from 8 billion currently to 10 billion in\n50 years. So, to peak around 2075. And to gradually\ndecline thereafter. They previously projected it would rise to\n11 billion by the end of the century and be continuing to\nrise. So, the projected peak in population has declined. But\nwe're still seeing quite significant population growth over\ntime.\nI think one of the other factors that gives rise to some\nconfusion over this is that the magic number of 2.1 of the\nreplacement rate. So, this is the rate that demographers\ntypically think of if fertility falls below 2.1, the global\n\n9\npopulation in a country or the globe, it will fall. And\nimportantly, we're at that 2.1 percent threshold globally.\nBut actually, that 2.1 percent figure isn't set in stone. That\nis only the replacement rate that stabilizes the population if\nyou have mortality fixed at current levels. If you have life\nexpectancy increasing over time, that replacement rate is\nsignificantly lower. Around 1.5, 1.6. So, actually, we're still\nat a global level, at a level of fertility that implies increased\npopulation growth over time.\nAllison Nathan: So, if I'm putting this all together,\npopulation aging is a consequence, as you said, of\nincreased longevity and declining fertility. Those are the\ntwo major factors. But if we think about population aging\nitself, how big of a problem is that really?\nKevin Daly: I mean, it is a problem. And the reason why\neconomists fret about it so much is because if you have a\nfall in the share of the population that is of working age,\nand if that follows, you know, one for one to a decline in\nemployment rates, then that will reduce employment in\npopulations, will reduce GDP, and will increase\ndependency ratios. So, that the number of dependents in\n\n10\nthe population dependent on those who are in employment.\nSo, if you go back to those figures that we quoted at the\nstart of the podcast, the working age ratio in developed\necosystem falling from 67 at a peak in just before 2000 to\n57, that's a 15 percent decline. If it is matched one for one\nfor a fall in employment, that will reduce employment and\nGDP by a similar amount.\nThe only solution, really in the long term to that increased\nlongevity, increased aging is for us also to work longer.\nOther factors may provide temporary fixes. But the only\nlong-term solution is that if we're living longer, we also\nhave to extend our working lives as well.\nAllison Nathan: So, do we see any evidence that's\nactually happening at this point? Are we working longer as\nwe're getting healthier and staying healthier for longer?\nKevin Daly: We are. That's the good news story to this as\nwell is that this is a problem if we weren't also working\nlonger. But the good news is that we are also working\nlonger. From 2000 in developed economies, longevity has\nincreased on average from 78 years to 82 years. That's a 5\n\n11\npercent increase in longevity. Whereas, effective working\nlives, so the amount using data that we ourselves have\ncalculated, have actually increased by 12 percent over that\nperiod from 34 to 38.\nSo, much as economists treat the working age ratio as\nbeing from 15 to 64, the reality is that people typically\ndon't enter the workplace at 15 because they're in\neducation. And they in many cases don't leave at the age of\n64. And what we're seeing is in their effective work lives,\nthe number of years they actually work, they have\nincreased significantly since 2000.\nAllison Nathan: By the way, I'm not sure everyone would\nagree that's good news, Kevin. I think we do aspire to not\nbe working for a very lengthy amount of time in our lives\nand have some enjoyment at the end there. But if you\nthink about why people are working longer, have you done\nany work in terms of why that is?\nKevin Daly: Yeah. Well, I mean, it's good news in the\nsense that it's an adjustment we have already made. We're\nalready well in the process to making. So, it's not an\nadjustment we have yet to make.\n\n12\nAnd if you look at the factors that have caused the increase\nin effective working lives, I think they are predominantly\ngood factors or positive factors. So, one has been an\nincrease in female participation after childbirth. So, there's\nbeen a significant increase in women extending their\nworking lives, particularly through improvements in\nchildcare provision and so forth, being able to continue in\nthe workforce after they have started having children.\nAnd then the second key factor has been the reduced\nimportance of manual labor. So, manual labor, we think of\nthings like construction, but also manufacturing jobs. A lot\nof manufacturing jobs in particular, these are tough jobs\nthat people typically retire from relatively early. As you've\nseen a reduced share of the workforce in manual jobs,\nyou're seeing an increase in the effective working hours as\na result of that as more and more people are doing office-\ntype jobs.\nAllison Nathan: So, Kevin, we began talking about this,\nthe underlying concern is that we're in this demographic\ntime bomb and that's going to ultimately have negative\nconsequences for economic growth. But what I'm hearing\n\n13\nfrom you is perhaps we don't need to be as concerned\nabout the implications on growth from all of this.\nKevin Daly: I agree. I think one of the factors that\ncontributes to these concerns is that people find it difficult\nto separate the process of getting older, which we all face,\nwhich is inherently worrying, with the process of economic\naging, which is actually less of a concern for society as a\nwhole. Economic transitions are always difficult, but this is\none that we're managing relatively well.\nAllison Nathan: Are there specific investment\nimplications of the work you've done?\nKevin Daly: I think there are. So, a lot of the analysis on\naging and the implication of aging makes the, in my mind,\nmistaken assumption that as our lives increase, we can\nhold everything else fixed. And so, what that implies in\npractice is that we're extending the amount of our lives that\nwe are in, quote/unquote, \"old age.\" I don't think that's an\naccurate description as the IMF work that I had mentioned\nearlier on highlights. Actually, a more accurate description\nis that we're extending each of the parts of our lives. So,\nwe're younger for longer. We're middle aged for longer.\n\n14\nWe're older for longer.\nAnd so, one implication of that is that there's not naturally\ngoing to be a shift from aging necessarily into increased\ndemand for goods and services that, quote unquote, \"old\npeople\" desire because we're extending all stages of our\nlives in proportion.\nAllison Nathan: So, Kevin, what is the bottom line here\nwhen we think about the implications of global aging on\nthe economy? It seems like it's not the concern that people\nmay think it is.\nKevin Daly: Yeah. First point is to say it's to a large sense\nbeen driven by increased life expectancy, which is a good\nthing in its own right, regardless of the economic\nimplications. But even on the economic implications, it's\nthat population aging is only a problem, increased longevity\nis only an issue, if we're not also extending our working\nlives in proportion.\nNow, the good news is not good news for everyone, but the\nreality is that actually across most countries, we have\nalready extended our working lives quite significantly. And\n\n15\nas a result, employment rates have risen, not fallen. And\ndependency ratios have actually declined rather than risen.\nAllison Nathan: Interesting. I think there's a lot of food\nfor thought there, Kevin. Thank you for joining us and\nsharing your insights. Really interesting work you're doing.\nKevin Daly: Thank you, Allison.\nAllison Nathan: This episode of Goldman Sachs\nExchanges was recorded on Thursday, May 29th, 2025. I'm\nAllison Nathan.

Watch for more from our Outlook in\ncoming weeks.\n\n\n\nLimited rebounds\nRatio of European vs. U.S. equity total returns, 2001-2025\n\nAs unusual as this year has seemed, we think it is a more acute manifestation of\nthe profound transformation underway for a few years now. Long-term macro\nanchors markets have relied on for decades, like stable inflation and fiscal\ndiscipline, have weakened. But that does not mean investors should trim risk\ntaking. Mega forces offer a new anchor for returns. And we see immutable\neconomic laws limiting policy shifts and narrowing near-term outcomes: supply\nchains can’t be rewired overnight and U.S. debt sustainability relies on large\nforeign funding. So, we’re Investing in the here and now – and putting more\nweight on our short-term views. We think today’s economic setup still favors\nU.S. outperformance. European stocks have bested U.S. peers many times since\n2000, including early this year, but it’s always faded. See the chart. We think\nEurope needs to advance its structural reforms to change that.\n\nThe recognition that immutable economic laws prevent fast deviation from the\nstatus quo allowed us to quickly dial risk back up after the April 2 tariff\nannouncements. And we now see even more cause to stay risk on and overweight\nU.S. equities. The U.S. is set to enact tax and regulatory reforms that could\nboost investor sentiment. We see scope for overall corporate earnings to stay\nsolid even if U.S. growth is dented by tariff-induced disruptions and corporate\ncaution.\n\nGetting active across asset classes\n\nIn fixed income, by contrast, we prefer euro area government bonds and credit\nover the U.S. Yields are more attractive in Europe than in the U.S. Yes,\nlong-term U.S. Treasury yields may temporarily fall as markets price in rate\ncuts amid shifting narratives, but we think sticky inflation will keep the\nFederal Reserve from cutting far. Plus, high fiscal deficits may prompt\ninvestors to seek more term premium, or compensation for the risk of holding\nlong-term U.S. debt. We also prefer local currency emerging market (EM) bonds as\nthe U.S. dollar could weaken more and the EM growth outlook is brighter.\n\nIn this volatile environment, we think it is important to carefully manage macro\nrisk: set-and-forget portfolios no longer serve investors well. We find other\nways of Taking risk with no macro anchor. They include relative value – or\npositioning for prices of different securities to converge or diverge –\nliquidity, regulation and positioning risk. Another way we inform our\nrisk-taking is by Finding anchors in mega forces. We believe they will be\ndurable drivers of returns in both the near and long term.\n\nAcross all asset classes, greater dispersion in market and security returns\nmeans more opportunity to capture alpha, or above-benchmark returns. Take mega\nforces as an example. They don’t provide a clear handle on the growth and\ninflation outlook, unlike macro anchors, and don’t map into broad return\ndrivers. Instead, we need to track their evolution across and within asset\nclasses, get granular with themes and constantly adapt to what’s priced in.\nGetting active applies across both public and private markets – and we see\ngreater blending of the two within portfolios. Look out for more on just how\nexceptional this environment is for alpha in coming weeks.\n\nOur bottom line\n\nAs long-term macro anchors weaken, we find new ones in mega forces and lean more\non our short-term views as immutable economic laws limit the pace of change. We\nstay overweight U.S. stocks and get active across asset classes.\n\nMarket backdrop\n\nU.S. stocks edged up to fresh record highs, with the AI theme taking the lead\nagain. The S&P 500 more than fully recovered from its nearly 15% slide after the\nApril 2 U.S. reciprocal tariffs announcement to end up about 11% in Q2 and up\n26% from April lows. U.S. 10-year yields edged up to 4.35% after payrolls\nincreased 147,000 in June, beating expectations. We think that highlights how\njob creation and wage growth would need to slow much more for inflation to\nsettle at the Fed’s 2% target.\n\nThis week, we are monitoring the expiration of the 90-day suspension of U.S.\nreciprocal tariffs announced on April 2. Negotiators from over a dozen U.S.\ntrading partners are working to finalize an agreement before the deadline. Only\nthe UK and Vietnam have reached a deal so far. Yet an immutable law – supply\nchains can’t be rewired overnight without serious disruption – means we don’t\nanticipate tariffs will return to April 2 highs. We watch to see if the pause\ngets extended.\n\nRead our past weekly market commentaries .\n\n \n\nBig calls\n\nOur highest conviction views on tactical (6-12 month) and strategic (long-term)\nhorizons, July 2025\n\nTactical granular views\n\nSix- to 12-month tactical views on selected assets vs. broad global asset\nclasses by level of conviction, July 2025\n\nLegend Granular\n\nThe table below reflects our views on a tactical horizon and, importantly,\nleaves aside the opportunity for alpha, or the potential to generate\nabove-benchmark returns – especially at times of heightened volatility.\n\nEuro-denominated tactical granular views\n\nSix to 12-month tactical views on selected assets vs. broad global asset classes\nby level of conviction, July 2025\n\nLegend Granular"}

Yet we think U.S. equities will regain global\nleadership as the AI theme keeps providing near-term earnings support and could\ndrive productivity in the long term.\n\nUsing FX to enhance income\n\nFX hedging is now a source of income, especially when hedging euro area bonds\nback into U.S. dollars. For example, 10-year government bonds in France or Spain\noffer more income when currency hedged than U.S. investment grade credit, with\nyields above 5%.\n\nSeeking alpha sources\n\nWe identify sources of risk taking to be more deliberate in earning alpha. These\ninclude the potential impact of regulatory changes on corporate earnings,\nspotting crowded positions where markets could snap back and opportunities to\nprovide liquidity during periods of stress.\n\nStrategic\n\n \n\nInfrastructure equity and private credit\n\nWe see opportunities in infrastructure equity due to attractive relative\nvaluations and mega forces. We think private credit will earn lending share as\nbanks retreat – and at attractive returns.\n\nFixed income granularity\n\nWe prefer short-term inflation-linked bonds over nominal developed market (DM)\ngovernment bonds, as U.S. tariffs could push up inflation. Within DM government\nbonds, we favor UK gilts over other regions.\n\nEquity granularity\n\nWe favor emerging over developed markets yet get selective in both. Emerging\nmarkets (EM) at the cross current of mega forces – like India – offer\nopportunities. In DM, we like Japan as the return of inflation and corporate\nreforms brighten the outlook.\n\nEquities\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nUnited States\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are overweight. Policy-driven volatility and supply-side constraints are\npressuring growth, but we see AI supporting corporate earnings. U.S. valuations\nare backed by stronger earnings and profitability relative to other developed\nmarkets.\n\nEurope\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Greater unity and a pro-growth agenda across Europe could boost\nactivity, yet we are watching how the bloc tackles its structural challenges\nbefore turning more optimistic. We note selective opportunities in financials\nand industries tied to defense and infrastructure spending.\n\nUK\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Political stability could improve investor sentiment. Yet an\nincrease in the corporate tax burden could hurt profit margins near term.\n\nJapan\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are overweight given the return of inflation and shareholder-friendly\ncorporate reforms. We prefer unhedged exposures as the yen has tended to\nstrengthen during bouts of market stress.\n\nEmerging markets (EM)\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Valuations and domestic policy are supportive. Yet geopolitical\ntensions and concerns about global growth keep us sidelined for now.\n\nChina\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Trade policy uncertainty keeps us cautious, and policy stimulus\nis still limited. We still see structural challenges to China’s growth,\nincluding an aging population.\n\nFixed income\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nShort U.S. Treasuries\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are overweight. We view short-term Treasuries as akin to cash in our tactical\nviews. We would still lean against the market pricing of multiple Fed rate cuts\nover the next year.\n\nLong U.S. Treasuries\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are underweight. Persistent budget deficits and inflation pressures could\ndrive term premium up over the long term, but we see scope for lower yields near\nterm. We prefer intermediate maturities.\n\nGlobal inflation-linked bonds\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are neutral. We see higher medium-term inflation, but cooling inflation and\ngrowth may matter more near term.\n\nEuro area government bonds\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Yields are attractive, and term premium has risen closer to our\nexpectations relative to U.S. Treasuries. We prefer peripheral bonds such as in\nItaly and Spain.\n\nUK gilts\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Gilt yields are off their highs, but the risk of higher U.S.\nyields having a knock-on impact and reducing the UK’s fiscal space has risen. We\nare monitoring the UK fiscal situation.\n\nJapanese government bonds\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are underweight. We see room for yields to rise further on Bank of Japan rate\nhikes and a higher global term premium\n\nChina government bonds\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Bonds are supported by looser policy. Yet we find yields more\nattractive in short-term DM paper.\n\nU.S. agency MBS\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are overweight. We find income in agency MBS compelling and prefer them to\nU.S. Treasuries for high-quality fixed income exposure.\n\nShort-term IG credit\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are overweight. Short-term bonds better compensate for interest rate risk.\n\nLong-term IG credit\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are underweight. Spreads are tight, so we prefer taking risk in equities. We\nfavor Europe over the U.S.\n\nGlobal high yield\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Spreads are tight, but corporate fundamentals are solid and it\nprovides attractive income.\n\nAsia credit\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are neutral. We don’t find valuations compelling enough to turn more\npositive.\n\nEmerging hard currency\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are underweight. Spreads to U.S. Treasuries are near historical averages.\nTrade uncertainty has eased, but we find local currency EM debt more attractive.\n\nEmerging local currency\n\n \n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Debt levels for many EMs have improved, and currencies have held\nup against trade uncertainty. We prefer countries with higher real interest\nrates.\n\nEquities\n\n \n\n \n\n Europe ex UK\n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Greater unity and a pro-growth agenda across Europe could boost\nactivity, yet we are watching how the bloc tackles its structural challenges\nbefore turning more optimistic. We note opportunities in financials and\nindustries tied to defense and infrastructure spending.\n\nGermany\n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Valuations and earnings growth are supportive relative to peers,\nespecially as ECB rate cuts ease financing conditions. Prolonged uncertainty\nabout potential tariffs and fading euphoria over China’s stimulus could dent\nsentiment.\n\nFrance\n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Ongoing political uncertainty could weigh on business conditions\nfor French companies. Yet only a small share of the revenues and operations of\nmajor French firms is tied to domestic activity.\n\nItaly\n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Valuations are supportive relative to peers. Yet past growth and\nearnings outperformance largely stemmed from significant fiscal stimulus in\n2022-2023, which is unlikely to be sustained in the coming years.\n\nSpain\n\n\n\nWe are overweight. Valuations and earnings growth are supportive compared to\nother euro area stocks. Financials, utilities and infrastructure stocks stand to\ngain from a strong economic backdrop and advancements in AI.\n\nNetherlands\n\n\n\nWe are neutral. The Dutch stock market’s tilt to technology and semiconductors —\nkey beneficiaries of rising AI demand—is offset by less favorable valuations and\na weaker earnings outlook compared to European peers.\n\nSwitzerland\n\n\n\nWe are neutral, consistent with our broader European view. Earnings have\nimproved, but valuations remain elevated compared to other European markets. The\nindex’s defensive tilt may offer less support if global risk appetite stays\nstrong.\n\nUK\n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Political stability could improve investor sentiment. Yet an\nincrease in the corporate tax burden could hurt profit margins near term.\n\nFixed income\n\n \n\n \n\nEuro area government bonds\n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Yields are attractive, and term premium has risen closer to our\nexpectations relative to U.S. Treasuries. We prefer peripheral bonds such as in\nItaly and Spain.\n\nGerman bunds\n\n\n\nWe are underweight. Market pricing aligns with our policy rate expectations, but\ngrowth support fiscal stimulus is likely to push up neutral rates. More balanced\ninflation risks and bond issuance could push term premium up.\n\nFrench OATs\n\n\n\nWe are underweight. France continues to face challenges from elevated political\nuncertainty, persistent budget deficits and a slower pace of structural reforms.\n\nItalian BTPs\n\n\n\nWe are neutral. The spread over German bunds looks tight given its large budget\ndeficits and growing public debt. Domestic factors remain supportive, with\ngrowth holding up relative to the rest of the euro area and Italian households\nshowing solid demand to hold BTPs at higher yields. Given the domestic political\npushback, we do not think Italy will boost defense spending to such an extent\nthat fiscal stability concerns resurface.\n\nUK gilts\n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Gilt yields are off their highs, but the risk of higher U.S.\nyields having a knock-on impact and reducing the UK’s fiscal space has risen. We\nare monitoring the UK fiscal situation.\n\nSwiss government bonds\n\n\n\nWe are neutral. Markets are expecting policy rates to return to negative\nterritory, which we deem as unlikely.\n\nEuropean inflation-linked bonds\n\n\n\nWe are neutral. We see higher medium-term inflation, but inflation expectations\nare firmly anchored. Cooling inflation and uncertain growth may matter more near\nterm.\n\nEuropean investment grade credit\n\n\n\nWe are neutral on European investment grade credit, favoring short- to\nmedium-term paper for quality income. We prefer European investment grade over\nthe U.S., as quality-adjusted spreads are relatively wider.\n\nEuropean high yield\n\n\n\nWe are overweight. The income potential is attractive, and we prefer European\nhigh yield for its more appealing valuations, higher quality and less\nsensitivity to interest rate swings compared with the U.S. Spreads adequately\ncompensate for the risk of a potential rise in defaults, in our view."}

Smaller-cap\nindexes performed best, with the S&P MidCap 400 and Russell 2000 indexes\nclimbing 2.85% and 3.52%, respectively, followed by the Dow Jones Industrial\nAverage, which advanced 2.30%. The S&P 500 Index and Nasdaq Composite both\nclosed at all-time highs for the second week in a row. U.S. markets closed early\nThursday and were closed Friday in observance of the Independence Day holiday,\nand T. Rowe Price traders noted that the week included several fairly quiet\ntrading sessions heading into the long weekend.\n\nMuch of the focus during the week centered around the progress of the Trump\nadministration’s reconciliation bill, which was narrowly passed by the Senate on\nTuesday and by the House of Representatives on Thursday afternoon. Trade-related\nheadlines also continued to flow during the week, with President Donald Trump\nannouncing a trade deal with Vietnam on Wednesday and making comments around\nnegotiations with several other trade partners ahead of the upcoming July 9\ntariff deadline, when the 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs is expected to end.\n\nJOB GROWTH REMAINS RESILIENT IN JUNE\n\nOn the economic data front, the Labor Department reported that the U.S. economy\nadded 147,000 jobs in June, ahead of economists’ estimates and up from May’s\nupwardly revised reading of 144,000. The unemployment rate ticked lower to 4.1%,\nwhile average hourly earnings grew 0.2% month over month.\n\nThe report came as a welcome surprise following Wednesday’s weaker-than-expected\ndata from payroll processing firm ADP, which showed private payrolls contracted\nby 33,000 in June against estimates for a gain of around 115,000. This was the\nfirst negative reading since March 2023 and was driven by “a hesitancy to hire\nand a reluctance to replace departing workers,” according to Nela Richardson,\nchief economist at ADP.\n\nElsewhere, the Labor Department reported on Tuesday that job openings rose to\n7.8 million in May, up from April’s reading of 7.4 million and the highest level\nsince November. Accommodation and food services had the largest increase in\nopenings, followed by finance and insurance. Initial jobless claims for the week\nended June 28 also came in better than expected at 233,000, down 4,000 from the\nprior week’s revised level.\n\nMANUFACTURING ACTIVITY CONTRACTS IN JUNE; SERVICES REBOUNDS TO EXPANSION\n\nActivity in the U.S. manufacturing sector contracted for the fourth consecutive\nmonth in June, according to a report from the Institute for Supply Management\n(ISM). The ISM’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI) was 49%, up from\nMay’s reading of 48.5% and just shy of estimates for 49.1% (readings below 50%\nindicate contraction). According to Susan Spence, chair of the ISM Manufacturing\nBusiness Survey Committee, “activity slowed its rate of contraction, with\nimprovements in inventories and production the biggest factors in the\n0.5-percentage-point gain.”\n\nMeanwhile, the services sector returned to growth after contracting for the\nfirst time in 11 months in May, registering a June PMI reading of 50.8%. The\nrebound was largely attributed to improvements in business activity and new\norders. The Prices Index eased 1.2 percentage points from May but remained\nsolidly in expansion territory—indicating rising prices—with a reading of 67.5%,\nthe second-highest reading since November 2022 and the seventh consecutive month\nabove 60%.\n\nHIGH YIELD BONDS ADVANCE AMID EQUITY MARKET STRENGTH \n\nU.S. Treasuries were little changed through Wednesday as yields fluctuated in\nresponse to the week’s mixed economic data. On Thursday morning, yields across\nmost maturities increased in response to the better-than-expected jobs report.\n\nInvestment-grade corporate bonds posted positive returns amid a light week of\nnew issuance, and all of the week’s new issues were oversubscribed. High yield\nbonds also generated positive returns, and T. Rowe Price traders noted that high\nyield market sentiment was generally firm as equities traded higher amid\ngenerally favorable macroeconomic conditions. Our traders also noted that the\nissuance calendar was active as issuers sought to take advantage of the positive\nsentiment ahead of the U.S. holiday.\n\nThis chart is for illustrative purposes only and does not represent the\nperformance of any specific security.

Major stock indexes posted mixed\nreturns. France’s CAC 40 Index gained 0.82% over these trading sessions,\nGermany’s DAX gave back 0.41%, and Italy’s FTSE MIB advanced 0.51%. The UK’s\nFTSE 100 Index tacked on 0.28%.\n\nEUROZONE INFLATION HITS 2% TARGET; LABOR MARKET STEADY\n\nHeadline annual inflation in the eurozone ticked up to the European Central\nBank’s (ECB’s) 2.0% target in June after hitting an eight-month low of 1.9% in\nMay. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, held at\n2.3%. However, the year-over-year increase in services costs, which policymakers\nmonitor closely, rose to 3.3% from 3.2%.\n\nMeanwhile, the labor market in the euro area remained strong. The seasonally\nadjusted jobless rate rose to 6.3% in May from a record low of 6.2% in April,\ncoming in just below the 6.4% from the same time last year.\n\nECB’S LAGARDE STRIKES CAUTIOUS NOTE ON INFLATION\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde reacted to the inflation data at the central\nbank’s annual forum in Sintra, Portugal, by saying that the ECB’s target had\nbeen reached—cooling expectations for further interest rate cuts this year.\nLater, she said: “It will take time for us to gather sufficient data to be\ncertain that the risks of above-target inflation have passed.” She added: “Our\nwork is not done, and we need to remain vigilant.”\n\nUK HOUSE PRICES FALL, NATIONWIDE SAYS; BOE DATA SHOW IMPROVING MORTGAGE MARKET\n\nThe UK Nationwide house price index fell 0.8% in June after rising 0.4% in the\npreceding month. Year over year, home prices were 2.1% higher. Nationwide said\nit expected prices to rise over the summer, when demand for houses is usually\nstrongest.\n\nBank of England (BoE) data suggested that the housing market was recovering from\na momentary downturn that occurred after the end of a tax break in April. Net\nmortgage approvals for home purchases, a key indicator of future borrowing, rose\nto 63,032 in May from an upwardly revised 60,656 in April and well above the\n59,750 forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.\n\nJAPAN\n\nJapan’s stock markets lost ground over the week through Thursday, with the\nNikkei 225 Index falling 0.91% and the broader TOPIX Index down 0.41%. Signs\nthat progress in U.S.-Japan trade negotiations was stalling weighed on\nsentiment. The yen benefited from broad-based dollar weakness, strengthening to\naround JPY 143.8 against the U.S. dollar from about JPY 144.6 at the end of the\nprevious week. The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.45%\nfrom the prior week’s 1.43%.\n\nInvestors’ focus was on the latest developments in the bilateral trade\nnegotiations between the U.S. and Japan—in the absence of an agreement, a 24%\nreciprocal tariff on Japanese imports is due to be reinstated by the U.S. on\nJuly 9. U.S. President Donald Trump spoke of imposing a 30% to 35% tariff if the\ntwo countries fail to reach a deal by the deadline, which his administration is\nunwilling to extend. Japan has reportedly continued to insist on the removal of\nall tariffs, notably on its key auto and auto parts industries, while the U.S.\nside is said to be pushing for Japan to import more U.S. agricultural products.\n\nBUSINESS SENTIMENT IMPROVES IN NEW SURVEY\n\nAmong firms, specifically Japan’s big manufacturers, business sentiment\nunexpectedly improved slightly in the three months to June, as shown by the Bank\nof Japan’s closely watched quarterly “tankan” survey. The index rose to +13 in\nJune, up from +12 in March and ahead of market expectations of +10. A positive\nnumber indicates that more firms are optimistic about recent business conditions\nthan are pessimistic. However, over the coming three months, big manufacturers\nexpect business confidence to fall.\n\nInvestors looked ahead to Japan’s Upper House election on July 20, which is\nexpected to lead to some political uncertainty in the short term. In the October\n2024 Lower House election, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, together with\nits coalition partner the Komeito party, lost its majority—and some investors\nare preparing for such an outcome in July’s election. Dissatisfaction with Prime\nMinister Shigeru Ishiba’s government has stemmed largely from cost-of-living\nissues.\n\nCHINA\n\nMainland Chinese stock markets rose for the week ended Thursday. The onshore\nbenchmark CSI 300 Index rose 1.18% and the Shanghai Composite Index added 1.08%\nin local currency terms, according to FactSet. In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang\nSeng Index shed 0.88%.\n\nA handful of indicators offered a mixed snapshot of China’s economy. The\nofficial manufacturing purchasing managers’ index improved in June to 49.7 from\nMay’s 49.5 reading, China’s statistics bureau reported Monday. The latest\nmanufacturing PMI reading captured the first full month after the U.S. and China\nagreed in May on a 90-day pause in their tariff war, which led to a temporary\nrebound in trade. Though the gauge stayed below the 50.0 reading that separates\ngrowth from contraction, it beat economists’ forecasts and raised doubts about\nwhether Beijing would step up stimulus measures in the near term.\n\nA private survey showed that the services side of the economy remained under\npressure, however. The Caixin China General Services PMI fell to 50.6 in June, a\nnine-month low, from May’s 51.1 reading, missing forecasts. Despite remaining in\nexpansionary territory, June’s growth pace was the softest since last September\nas the pace of new business growth slowed, Caixin said in a statement. A gauge\nof employment fell for the third time in the past four months as service\nproviders remained cautious about hiring.\n\nOTHER KEY MARKETS\n\nPOLAND\n\nCENTRAL BANK SURPRISES INVESTORS WITH UNEXPECTED RATE CUT\n\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday, Poland’s central bank held its two-day monetary policy\nmeeting, and policymakers surprised investors by deciding to reduce the key\ninterest rate, the reference rate, from 5.25% to 5.00%. Other interest rates\ncontrolled by the central bank were also reduced by 25 basis points (0.25%).\n\nAccording to the post-meeting statement, policymakers once again deemed the\nglobal backdrop for economic activity and inflation as being “subject to\nuncertainty” due to trade policies and other factors. Turning to the Polish\neconomy, central bank officials noted that enterprise sector employment in May\nwas lower than it was one year ago and that annual wage growth in the national\neconomy and in the enterprise sector showed signs of slowing.\n\nAccording to their latest projections, policymakers believe that inflation will\nbe slightly lower than previously expected in the next couple of years and that\neconomic growth will be slightly higher. In addition, central bank officials\nforecast that consumer price index inflation in the months ahead “will fall\nbelow the upper bound for deviations” of the central bank’s inflation target.\nThey used this as the justification for their decision to reduce interest rates\nat this time.\n\nCOLOMBIA\n\nDIVIDED BOARD OF DIRECTORS VOTES TO KEEP RATES STEADY \n\nLate last week, the Colombian central bank’s Board of Directors held its\nregularly scheduled policy meeting, and policymakers decided to keep the\nmonetary policy interest rate at 9.25%. However, the decision was not unanimous.\nWhile four of the seven directors voted to keep rates steady, two directors\nvoted for a 50-basis-point (0.50%) rate cut, while one favored a 25-basis-point\n(0.25%) cut.\n\nIn their post-meeting statement, policymakers noted that annual headline\ninflation and core inflation edged lower between April and May. However, they\nalso noted that inflation expectations remain above the central bank’s 3%\ntarget, indicating that “convergence toward the target is perceived to be slower\nthan previously anticipated.”\n\nIn addition, policymakers observed that economic growth “has accelerated,”\nleading the technical staff to upgrade their full-year growth forecast for the\neconomy. Further, central bank officials acknowledged that the expected increase\nin this year’s fiscal deficit “and beyond…limits the scope for further monetary\npolicy easing.” As a result, the majority of Board members voted to keep rates\nunchanged, reflecting a “cautious approach” to monetary policy.\n\nImportant Information\n\nThis material is provided for informational purposes only and is not intended to\nbe investment advice or a recommendation to take any particular investment\naction.\n\nThe views are as of the date written and are subject to change without notice;\nthese views may differ from those of other T. Rowe Price affiliated companies\nand/or associates.\n\nThis information is not intended to reflect a current or past recommendation\nconcerning investments, investment strategies, or account types, advice of any\nkind, or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any securities or investment\nservices.

There are many factors that can drive\n   currency values. Often when the price of oil rises the value of the dollar\n   declines. That is because rising oil prices reduce demand for oil. Given that\n   oil is traded in dollars, weaker demand for oil means weaker demand for\n   dollars. Lately, however, the price of oil fell while the dollar fell as\n   well. Thus, the dollar’s value was evidently influenced by other factors.\n\nOne factor that drives currency values is disparity between monetary policies,\nor at least disparity between expectations of monetary policy. The European\nCentral Bank (ECB) is on a path of monetary easing, with an expectation that\nthis will continue. Meanwhile, the US Federal Reserve is taking a wait and see\napproach, with investors now expecting less monetary easing by the Fed than by\nthe ECB. This set of circumstances suggests a rising US dollar. Yet that has not\nbeen the case. The futures markets meanwhile indicate that investors’ implied\nprobability of ECB rate cuts has declined slightly due to the rise in oil prices\nsince very recently, which might partially explain the rise in the euro. \n\nIn any event, the continuing decline in the value of the US dollar is most\nlikely associated with the continuing trade policy of the United States and the\nuncertainty surrounding this policy. The expectation that the US role in global\ntrade will diminish potentially means less demand for dollars. Plus, uncertainty\nand a perception of unpredictable policy also leads investors to diversify\nportfolios to reduce exposure to US-related risk. These factors appear to be\noutweighing the impact of oil prices and monetary policies. \n\nWhile the US dollar becomes less popular with global investors, it is that\nFrench President Macron is urging other leaders within the European Union (EU)\nto take steps to make the euro a more important global currency, specifically\nthrough the issuance of joint EU debt. Indeed, IMF Managing Director Georgieva\nsaid, “There is a great opportunity for the euro to play a bigger role globally.\nWhen I look at the search for quality safe assets, at this point it is facing a\nconstraint on the offering of these assets. It is not by chance that so much now\nis being parked in gold.”\n\nOIL PRICES AND WAR\n\n * Israel and Iran are at war and the is elevated, having risen sharply when the\n   war started. However, the price has settled at only a slightly elevated level\n   as investors began to believe that the war is not likely to disrupt oil\n   supplies. For the war to disrupt oil supplies, Iran would have to use force\n   to close the Straits of Hormuz, a power that they might lack following\n   massive Israeli attacks on Iran’s military. Moreover, even if there is\n   disruption in the Straits, Saudi Arabia has pipelines that can bring Persian\n   Gulf oil to the Red Sea for shipping. And, even before the war began, the\n   Saudis had chosen to boost their production of oil, thus offsetting the\n   impact of Israeli attacks on Iran’s oil-producing facilities. Thus, the\n   world’s oil supply appears to be relatively safe.\n\nIndeed, historically, conflict in the Middle East has rarely had a significant\nimpact on the global economy. The only times in modern history that events in\nthe Middle East were truly disruptive were in 1974 and 1979. In 1974, the war\nbetween Israel and Egypt led Arab oil producers to impose a boycott of Western\ncountries for supporting Israel. This led to a quadrupling of the price of oil.\nIn 1979, the Iranian revolution disrupted Iran’s oil production at a time when\noil supplies were tight, thereby causing a doubling of the oil price. In both\ncases, global inflation soared while real income declined. Tighter monetary\npolicies brought on recession in most major economies. Yet, when oil prices\nsurged in 1990 following the Iraq-Kuwait conflict, the impact was short lived.\nThe same was true in 2003 during the US-Iraq conflict and in 2022 during the\nstart of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. This time is likely to be similar.\n\nCHINESE ECONOMIC DATA OFFERS MIXED SIGNALS\n\n * In China, efforts to boost the growth of consumer spending appear to be\n   paying off while the trade conflict with the United States is undermining\n   industrial production and investment. The that, in May, retail sales (not\n   adjusted for inflation) were up 6.4% from a year earlier, the fastest growth\n   since December 2023. Moreover, most of that increase was real given that\n   inflation remains close to zero. The government has provided subsidies meant\n   to boost replacement of home appliances. In fact, retail sales of household\n   appliances were up 53% in May versus a year earlier. Other areas of strong\n   growth included sports and entertainment (up 28.3%), gold and silver (up\n   21.8%), and office supplies (up 30.5%).\n\nOn the other hand, industrial production was up more modestly, rising 5.8% in\nMay from a year earlier, the slowest rate of growth since November 2024. The\nslowdown in growth was likely due to US tariffs, which reduced overseas demand\nfor Chinese output. The manufacturing component of industrial production was up\n6.2%, the slowest rate of growth since November 2024. Still, there were areas of\nstrength. These included automotive (up 11.6%), computers and communication (up\n10.2%), and railway and shipbuilding (up 10.2%).\n\nIn addition, the Chinese government that fixed asset investment was up a modest\n3.7% in the first five months of 2025 from a year earlier. While the\nmanufacturing component was up a strong 8.5%, investment in real estate fell\n10.7%. Excluding real estate, investment increased by a more robust 7.7%.\n\nUS RETAIL SALES FALL SHARPLY WHILE FEDERAL RESERVE SITS TIGHT\n\n * In the United States, fell in May by the most in two years as tariffs started\n   to have a significant impact on spending. The government reported that, in\n   May, retail sales (not adjusted for inflation) were down 0.9% from the\n   previous month. This included a 3.9% decline in spending at automotive\n   dealers and a 2% decline at gasoline stations, the latter due to a decline in\n   energy prices. When auto sales and gasoline are excluded, retail sales were\n   down a more modest 0.1%.\n\nMeanwhile, some other categories saw significant declines. These included home\nimprovement retailers (down 2.7%), electronics and appliance stores (down 0.6%),\ndepartment stores (down 0.4%), and food service and drinking places (down 0.9%).\nOn the other hand, spending was up 0.9% at non-store retailers, up 1.3% at\nsporting goods stores, and up 1.2% at furniture stores.\n\nTariffs have so far not influenced consumer prices in a significant way. Thus,\nthe decline in spending in May was likely an offset to the frontloading of\nspending earlier this year, which had been in anticipation of tariffs. Going\nforward, if prices start to rise significantly, the tariffs will likely have a\nnegative impact on spending. \n\nFor the Federal Reserve, this situation will represent a challenge. It will\nlikely face higher inflation but weaker demand, the so-called “stagflation”\nscenario. If the Fed perceives the inflationary impact of tariffs to be\ntransitory, it might choose to ease monetary policy. If, on the other hand, it\nworries that the tariff-related inflation will be self-sustaining, then it will\nlikely keep monetary policy tight. Currently, futures markets are betting on two\nto three interest rate reductions later this year. \n\nMeanwhile, and as expected, the benchmark interest rate unchanged. Notably, the\nFed downwardly revised its forecast for economic growth and upwardly revised its\nforecast for inflation—both decisions based on expectations for tariff policy.\nThe decision to leave interest rates unchanged represented the fourth\nconsecutive meeting of Fed policymakers in which policy remained unchanged.\nInvestor reaction was relatively muted given that the decision was expected.\n\nThe decision to hold off on interest rate moves was based on uncertainty. Fed\nChair Powell said that “for the time being, we are well positioned to wait to\nlearn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any\nadjustments to our policy stance.” \n\nPowell also said that “our job is to make sure that a one-time increase in\ninflation doesn’t turn into an inflation problem.” That is, although the\ninflationary impact of tariffs could be transitory as they are a one-off event,\nthey could also create a wage-price spiral that would set off prolonged\ninflation. The degree to which this is true will depend on the tightness of the\nlabor market. Tariffs will certainly weaken aggregate demand in the economy,\nthereby weakening wage pressure. On the other hand, reduced immigration could\nexacerbate labor market tightness, thereby boosting wage pressure. Thus, there\nare many moving parts that the Fed will need to consider. \n\nThe debate about whether the one-off event of tariffs will have a transitory\nimpact on inflation recalls a similar debate during the pandemic. At that time,\nPowell said that inflation was driven by supply chain disruption and would have\na transitory impact on inflation. At the same time, some critics said that\ninflation would not be transitory and that a sizable increase in unemployment\nwould be required to defeat inflation. It turns out that Powell was correct.\nInflation went away quickly without much disruption to the labor market. The\nsame could happen again.\n\nBANK OF JAPAN LEAVES POLICY UNCHANGED\n\n * Facing an uncertain economic environment, (BOJ) left its benchmark interest\n   rate unchanged today. In addition, the BOJ has been reducing bond purchases\n   as part of its effective monetary tightening. Yet the BOJ announced that it\n   will slow down the reduction in bond purchases, evidently concerned that\n   Japan faces significant headwinds. The BOJ currently owns more than half of\n   Japanese government bonds, having purchased heavily when inflation was low.\n   The recent policy of slowing purchases was meant to move Japan’s bond market\n   toward normality. Yet the recent decision means this process will temporarily\n   slow down.\n\nCurrently, inflation in Japan is higher than desired. Yet the uncertain trade\nconflict with the United States means there is a downside risk to economic\ngrowth, depending on what happens in the current trade talks with the United\nStates. Indeed, the BOJ has downgraded its forecast for inflation as well as its\nforecast for economic growth. Hence, the BOJ has chosen to take a wait and see\napproach to monetary policy rather than continuing the path of monetary\ntightening meant to fight inflationary pressure. In response to the BOJ action,\nthe yen initially rose but later stabilized.\n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n * \n\nCHINA-US TRADE IS DISRUPTED\n\n * The disruption to global trade stemming from US trade policy became apparent\n   recently when its export statistics for May. Overall exports were up a modest\n   4.8% in May from a year earlier. However, exports to most countries grew at a\n   healthy pace while exports to the United States were down 34.5% from a year\n   earlier, the steepest decline since February 2020 as the pandemic began.\n   Recall that, during the first 13 days of May, Chinese exports to the United\n   States faced a 145% tariff. Then, a deal between the two sides led to the US\n   tariff falling to 30%—still high, but not catastrophic—and the Chinese tariff\n   falling from 125% to 10%. Thus, it seems likely that the decline in exports\n   largely took place during the first third of the month.\n\nMeanwhile, were up 12% in May from a year earlier while exports were up 6.2% to\nJapan, 7.5% to Taiwan, 12.6% to Australia, 14.8% to Southeast Asia, and a\ndecline of 1.2% to South Korea. The sharp rise in exports to Southeast Asia\nsuggests that goods were being transshipped to the United States, or at least\ncomponents were being sent to the region for final assembly and shipment to the\nUnited States.\n\nNotably, Chinese exports of rare earth minerals surged in May, up 23% from just\nthe previous month. The issue of Chinese exports of is one of the topics of\ndiscussion as US-China trade talks begin in a week or so in London. Currently,\nthe United States imposes a minimum tariff of 30% on imports from China, with\nhigher tariffs on some goods. China imposes a 10% tariff on the United States.\nThe two sides agreed to postpone higher tariffs until early August while talks\ntake place.\n\nThe United States seeks not only lower tariffs and non-tariff barriers from\nChina, but it also wants commitments for more Chinese purchases of US goods.\nPerhaps most importantly, the United States wants an end to Chinese restrictions\non exports of rare earth minerals, which are critically important to US\ntechnology and clean energy companies. China has signaled amenability to\ndiscussing this issue. A top US administration official said that Chinese\n“exports of critical minerals have been getting released at a rate that is\nhigher than it was, but not as high as we believe we agreed to in Geneva” when\nthe initial trade deal was reached. China accounts for roughly 60% of the mining\nof rare earths and 85% of the processing. Thus, it has considerable leverage.\nMeanwhile, China seeks lower US tariffs and fewer US export restrictions related\nto technology.\n\nAlso, fell in May from a year earlier, the fourth consecutive month in which\nthis has happened. Imports were down 3.8% from a year earlier, which included an\n18% decline in imports from the United States. That decline likely reflected the\nimpact of China’s tariffs as well as reduced Chinese production of goods bound\nfor the United States, which require imported inputs. China’s imports from the\nrest of the world were up.\n\nGoing forward, the uncertainty about the future path of trade relations between\nthe United States and China will likely stifle any cross-border investment.\nOrdinarily this uncertainty would lead to increased investment outside of China\nas global companies seek to reduce the risk of being hurt by the fraught\nUS-China relationship. Yet given that the United States has proposed and then\npostponed severe tariffs on other countries, it is not clear where companies\nshould invest as an alternative to China. Previously Vietnam was a favored\ndestination. Yet in early April the United States proposed a 46% tariff on\nimports from Vietnam, which was later postponed. US companies are now the US\ngovernment not to impose severe tariffs on Vietnam.\n\nTHE UNITED STATES AND CHINA REACH A DEAL\n\n * The United States and China have . The details remain spotty, but some\n   aspects are known. In a social media post, President Trump said that the\n   United States will have full access to Chinese rare earth minerals and\n   magnets, and that Chinese students will be able to obtain visas for study in\n   the United States. As for tariffs, Trump said that the United States will\n   charge tariffs of 55% while China will charge 10%. It is not entirely clear\n   what this entails. However, one analyst suggested that this means the United\n   States will retain the 10% baseline tariff that has been applied to most\n   other countries, the 20% tariff imposed early in the administration meant to\n   compel China to address the fentanyl issue, and tariffs of up to 25% on\n   specific products that were introduced during the first Trump Administration.\n\nThe tariffs of up to 55% are extremely high, and evidently no different than the\ncurrent tariffs. Plus, this level of tariffs is likely to stifle imports or, at\nthe least, lead to very high prices. For businesses that produce the products\nfacing such tariffs, there will be a strong incentive to shift production\nelsewhere. However, not knowing what tariff rates will be applied to other\ncountries makes it difficult to choose where to go. \n\nNothing has been said about the issue of US export restrictions related to high\ntechnology products. This was an issue that concerned China. An administration\nofficial had previously that the United States might make changes regarding this\npolicy. Meanwhile, has left in place the tariffs that a lower court ruled are\nillegal, at least until the appeals process takes place, now scheduled to begin\non July 31.   \n\nFinancial markets reacted relatively well to the announcement of the US-China\ndeal. Equity prices were initially up but ended the day in modest negative\nterritory. Bond yields were flat for the day.\n\nTHE BACKDROP TO THE US-CHINA DEAL\n\n * During several recent presentations, I asked the audience to answer several\n   polling questions. This was required for audience members to receive CPE\n   credit. In each case, I asked the audience which country was likely to suffer\n   the most from the trade wars. The choices were Canada, China, Japan, and\n   Mexico. In every case, the audience overwhelmingly said that China would\n   suffer the most. They were wrong.\n\nThe audiences evidently held the belief that China is hugely vulnerable to US\ntrade restrictions. The reality is that China is far more resilient than\nexpected and far less dependent on the United States than it used to be.\nMoreover, China has advantages that put the United States at risk. These facts\nwill influence the outcome of the current trade talks between the United States\nand China. \n\nWhen the new US administration began, was that China’s economy was weak and\nvulnerable. Domestic demand was growing slowly. Export growth accounted for a\ndisproportionate share of growth, and it faced potential obstacles from US trade\npolicy. This meant that, if the United States puts pressure on China, it would\nhave no choice but to make concessions. \n\nYet what was forgotten was that, following the 2018 trade conflict between China\nand the United States, trade patterns shifted. That is because US investment\ninto China shifted toward other places, such as Southeast Asia, with companies\neager to risk their exposure to China given the fraught relationship between the\nUnited States and China. Trade patterns followed the shift in investment. From\n2018 to 2024 about 42% while its about 18%. Thus, the United States was no\nlonger of considerable importance to Chinese trade. China could afford to absorb\nUS obstacles. Moreover, by 2024, China was already shifting economic policy\ntoward a focus on boosting domestic demand. Thus, exports were becoming of less\nimportance in driving economic growth.\n\nMeanwhile, China has a trump card, so to speak. It accounts for 70% of rare\nearth mining and 90% of rare earth processing. In addition, it also accounts for\na very large share of processing of graphite, cobalt, lithium, and copper. These\nminerals are critically important in the development of information technology,\ncommunications, and clean energy. Since the trade dispute of 2018, US exports to\nChina have grown rapidly, thereby putting US exporters at risk should China\nimpose severe tariffs. Some US companies and industries, such as agriculture and\naerospace, rely heavily on China.\n\nWHAT WILL THE UNITED STATES DO NEXT?\n\n * Each time there is some easing of trade tensions between the United States\n   and other countries, some investors and pundits start to think that the trade\n   war reached its peak and that trade tensions will decline. Yet each time this\n   happens, something else happens to intensify the trade war. That might be\n   about to happen. Recently, President Trump that, within one or two weeks, he\n   will send letters to dozens of countries outlining the terms of trade\n   agreements, saying that they can either “take them or leave them.”\n\nOn the other hand, he also said that he is amenable to extending the July 8\ndeadline for determining country tariff rates, although he said he doesn’t think\nit will be necessary. He hinted that negotiations are taking place with 15\ncountries including Japan and South Korea. He “but as you know, we have about\n150-plus, and you can't [make a deal with all of them]. So, we're going to be\nsending letters out in about a week and a half, two weeks, to countries and\ntelling them what the deal is.” \n\nRecall that, on April 2, the president proposed some very high tariffs on a wide\nrange of countries. Then, on April 9, he paused those tariffs, pending\nnegotiations, with a deadline of July 9. Now it appears that, with the deadline\nnearing, the president is simply prepared to tell other countries what he wants\nand what the tariff rates will be. As the , “At a certain point, we’re just\ngoing to send letters out.”\n\nMeanwhile, Treasury Secretary Bessent said that, with major trading partners,\nthere is likely to be an extension beyond July 9 if a deal is not reached soon.\nHe said that “there are 18 important trading partners—we are working toward\ndeals on those—and it is highly likely that those countries that are ...\nnegotiating in good faith, we will roll the date forward.\"\n\nIt is hard to know how to interpret these statements, but it leaves open the\npossibility of high tariffs on a wide range of countries, and possibly low\ntariffs on others. We simply don’t know. As I’ve written before, it is\nuncertainty that is unnerving many business leaders, unable to make informed\ndecisions about future supply chain strategy. \n\nMeanwhile, the United States has reached agreements with the United Kingdom and\nChina. These deals did not lead to significantly lower tariffs than previously,\nsuggesting that the United States will be content with deals that do not lower\ntariffs. If that is the case, then businesses should anticipate a world in which\ntariffs are historically high. That, in turn, would likely lead to major\ninvestments in shifting supply chain design, including some re-shoring of\nprocesses for US-based companies.\n\nDOWNWARD US DOLLAR: WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?\n\n * The value of the US dollar continues to decline against most major\n   currencies, reaching levels not seen since 2022. Normally, an increase in\n   tariffs leads to a higher valued currency. One reason is that tariffs lead to\n   lower volumes of imports, thereby reducing demand for foreign currency\n   (higher demand for domestic currency). Yet in this case, we have seen\n   downward pressure on the US dollar ever since the announcement of high\n   tariffs in early April.\n\nWhy has the dollar’s value been suppressed? There are several reasons. First,\nand perhaps foremost, high tariffs and trade uncertainty have undermined global\ninvestor confidence in the global role of the United States. If US trade shrinks\ndue to tariffs, then global demand for dollars will shrink. Consequently, global\ninvestors have been reducing their exposure to the US dollar, diversifying their\nportfolios and purchasing assets denominated in other currencies such as\nJapanese yen, Swiss francs, and euros. \n\nSecond, the argument has been made that the strength and dominance of the US\ndollar has been based, in part, on the global protective role of the US\nmilitary. Economist that countries that are engaged in military alliances with\nthe United States tend to hold more dollars than is warranted simply on an\neconomic basis. This is nothing new. The same was true of the British pound in\nthe 19th century when Britain dominated the seas. Now, with many US allies\nsignificantly boosting their own defense spending, in part due to the view that\nthe United States is less committed to its alliances than previously, investors\nare shying away from dollars. Indeed, it was announced that the United States is\npotentially rethinking its with the United Kingdom and Australia. \n\nFinally, currency values are often related to expectations of economic growth.\nIf one country is seen as having better growth prospects than another, this\ntends to boost the value of the first country’s currency—all other things being\nequal. Lately, expectations of US growth have been by many economists while\nexpectations for the Eurozone have been boosted. These trends would tend to\nsuppress the value of the dollar.\n\nUS INFLATION NOT YET AFFECTED BY TARIFFS\n\n * US inflation has not yet been noticeably influenced by tariffs or lower\n   immigration. The government today that inflation accelerated slightly from\n   April to May but remains very low. Specifically, consumer prices were up 2.4%\n   in May versus a year earlier, up from 2.3% in April. Prices were up only 0.1%\n   from April to May.  \n\nWhen volatile food and energy prices are excluded, core prices were up 2.8% in\nMay versus a year earlier, the same as in March and April. Core prices were up\n0.1% from April to May. On the other hand, core commodity prices were up 0.3% in\nMay versus a year earlier, the biggest gain since August 2023. This might\nreflect the early impact of tariffs, although it is too early to say. \n\nSignificant tariffs have only been in place since mid-April. Moreover, there had\nbeen a dramatic increase in imports during the first three months of the year,\nwith much of that leading to a big increase in inventories. Thus, it is likely\nthat there remains a large supply of goods that can still be sold at low prices.\nThe impact of tariffs, consequently, will take some time to be felt. \n\nMeanwhile, prices of services continued to decelerate. Service prices were up\n3.7% from a year earlier, the lowest since October 2021. However, service\ninflation in May was barely changed from April and March. Thus, it appears to be\nstabilizing. If the decline in immigration continues, this could lead to labor\nshortages in service industries, potentially boosting wage growth. The\ngovernment has that the number of foreign-born people participating in the US\nlabor force fell by one million from March to May, possibly due to lower\nimmigration, but possibly due to undocumented foreigners recoiling from\nparticipation for fear of being deported.\n\nFor the Federal Reserve, the current state of inflation would ordinarily lead to\na further easing of monetary policy. Yet the uncertainty about the potential\ninflationary impact of tariffs, as well as uncertainty about what level of\ntariffs will remain, will likely lead the Fed to postpone decisions about\ninterest rates until later this year.\n\n * \n * \n * \n * \n\nA PRIMER TO HELP UNDERSTAND THE US TRADE DEFICIT\n\n * While there is a lot of public discussion about the US trade deficit, often\n   the discussion does not explain how the trade deficit comes about, why it\n   could be bad or good for the economy, and how it is related to other things\n   such as the budget deficit, the amount of private savings, and the amount of\n   foreign investment coming into the United States. Moreover, there are\n   proposals to change the budget deficit and to possibly tax foreign\n   investment, either of which could influence the size of the trade deficit.\n   Let’s begin with the basics.\n\nLike any country, the United States engages in trade with other countries in\nboth goods and services. It buys more goods than it sells (a merchandise trade\ndeficit) and sells more services than it buys (a services surplus). The two\ntogether, plus a few smaller items, make up the current account balance, which\nis in deficit. This means that, overall, the United States buys more from other\ncountries than it sells. This leaves foreigners with extra US dollars. The only\nthing they can do with dollars, other than buy US goods and services, is to\ninvest in the United States—which is what they do.\n\nIn fact, there is more inbound investment into the United States than outbound\ninvestment from the United States. This is an investment, or capital,\nsurplus. The capital surplus almost exactly offsets the current account\ndeficit. This is an arithmetic requirement. Many readers are accountants, so\nyou’re accustomed to double entry accounts. In the external accounts of the\nUnited States, there are two sides: the current account and the capital\naccount. Unless the US government separately engages in currency transactions,\nthe two sides must be equal. This is the balance of payments and it, well,\nbalances.\n\nSo, is the current account deficit a bad thing? If it is, then the capital\naccount surplus must also be a bad thing. But can that be right? After all, a\nnet inflow of capital into the United States adds to investment, lowers US\nborrowing costs, and contributes to economic growth. Those are good things,\nimplying that the current account deficit is not necessarily bad. The angst over\nthe trade deficit possibly stems from the negative connotation of the word\n“deficit.” If we simply spoke of a capital account surplus, people might think\nit is a good thing.\n\nYet surely there must be times when a current account deficit is a bad thing.\nWhen is that the case? If it leads a country to accumulate too many obligations\nto other countries. Some emerging countries have excessive external debts that\nthey struggle to service. In that case, it would make sense to try to cut the\ncurrent account deficit, possibly by depreciating the currency to drive more\nexports and limit imports. This, however, is not the situation in which the\nUnited States finds itself.\n\nStill, the US government has a large budget deficit, which must be financed by\nborrowing, and much of the borrowing involves foreigners purchasing US\ngovernment bonds. Thus, some of the inbound investment goes toward funding the\nbudget deficit. Foreigners purchase bonds because they offer a favorable\nreturn. If the US government increases its deficit, it must borrow more, either\nfrom domestic savers or foreigners. If it borrows more from foreigners, this\nnecessarily requires an increase in the current account deficit. If foreigners\nbecome wary of holding US government bonds, then they will likely push up bond\nyields and push down the value of the dollar, which is what has happened\nlately. Trade uncertainty, combined with concern that the United States is\nboosting its deficit at a time of full employment, has led to increased concern\non the part of many investors.\n\nMoreover, the budget bill recently passed by the US House of Representatives\ncontains a measure () that allows the Treasury to boost taxes on foreign\ninvestors if their home country engages in discriminatory behavior toward the\nUnited States. This has generated concern on Wall Street. Taxing foreign\ninvestment, or even the threat of doing so, could reduce the volume of inbound\ninvestment and/or lead to higher borrowing costs.\n\nHowever, the proposed tax on foreign investment is consistent with , Trumps’ top\neconomist, that there is a need to curtail inbound investment. His argument is\nthat inflows of capital, driven in part by the dominant role of the US dollar,\nboost the value of the dollar, thereby hurting US export competitiveness and\nundermining the US manufacturing sector. Miran says that this is why the United\nStates has a trade deficit. Curtailing such investment is, therefore, meant to\nrestore manufacturing and reduce the trade deficit. Yet this assumes that the\ndominant role of the dollar is hurting the United States. Instead, one can argue\nthat the dominant role helps to keep US borrowing costs low and attracts\ninvestment, which helps economic growth.\n\nUS JOB MARKET: SURPRISING STRONG YET INDICATING POTENTIAL WEAKNESS\n\n * The US government released its . There are two parts to the report: one based\n   on a survey of households; the other based on a survey of establishments. The\n   two surveys offered very different implications for the job market. The\n   establishment survey found fairly good job growth, although most of it was in\n   health care and restaurants. The household survey found a sharp decline in\n   labor force participation, suggesting that the labor market is weakening.\n   Let’s look at the details.\n\nThe establishment survey found that 139,000 jobs were created in May. While\nslower than in April, it was better than in the first three months of the year.\nMoreover, it was more job growth than is needed to absorb entrants into the\nlabor force. As such, it was surprisingly good. Indeed, press commentary about\nthe report was mostly favorable, and US equity prices rose accordingly.\n\nOn the other hand, the survey found that the lion’s share of job growth was\nconcentrated in a few categories, with many categories experiencing declining\nemployment or slow growth. For example, there was a decline in employment in\nmanufacturing, especially in durable goods. There was also a decline in\nemployment in retail trade and a sharp decline for professional and business\nservices. And there was a sharp decline in employment at the Federal government.\nThere was only very modest growth for information, financial services,\ntransportation/warehousing, hotels, and zero growth at state governments.\n\nStrong growth of employment was seen in health care (up 62,200), food service\nand drinking places (up 30,200), and local government (up 21,000). These three\ncategories accounted for 82% of job growth in May. Thus, most categories were\nweak, suggesting that the labor market may be on a decelerating path.\n\nThe establishment survey also includes data on wages. It found that, in May,\naverage hourly earnings of workers were up 3.9% from a year earlier, the same\nrate of growth as in the previous four months. Given that consumer price\ninflation in May was 2.3%, this implies that real (inflation-adjusted) wages\ncontinue to rise, thereby boosting household spending power. Still,  found that\nconsumers expect a surge in inflation in the coming months owing to tariffs.\nThat would imply a decline in purchasing power.\n\nThe separate survey of households was grim. It found that the number of people\nparticipating in the labor force fell 625,000 from the previous month. Thus, the\nlabor force participation rate fell from 62.6% in April to 62.4% in May. It fell\nfor both men and women. In addition, the survey found that the number of people\nnot in the labor force increased 813,000 from the previous month. The number of\npeople reporting being employed fell 696,000 from the previous month. The\nunemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%.\n\nAlthough the two separate surveys offered very different results, the reality is\nthat both surveys found evidence of a weakening of the job market. This could be\nrelated to the impact of tariff uncertainty. Meanwhile, President Trump pointed\nto the employment report as a reason for the Federal Reserve to cut the\nbenchmark interest rate by 100 basis points. From the Fed’s perspective, the\neconomy remains relatively strong. Moreover, there is a risk of higher inflation\nfrom tariffs.\n\nCurrently,  in a 30.1% chance of only one interest-rate reduction this year.\nThat is up from 3.9% a month ago. In addition, markets are pricing in a 39.6%\nchance of two rate cuts and a 19.8% chance of three cuts this year. One month\nago, investors were pricing in a 67% chance of either three or four rate cuts\nthis year. Evidently investors have become more cautious about their\nexpectations for the Fed, possibly because the economy has remained stronger\nthan anticipated.\n\nEUROZONE INFLATION DOWN WHILE THE ECB CUTS RATES\n\n * Consumer prices in  were up only 1.9% in May versus a year earlier. This was\n   the lowest rate since September 2024 and the second lowest rate since April\n   2021. Moreover, inflation has been steadily decelerating since January of\n   this year.\n\nWhen volatile food and energy prices are excluded, core prices were up 2.3% in\nMay versus a year earlier, the lowest rate of underlying inflation since October\n2021. As such, it appears that inflation has largely been defeated in the\nEurozone. This sets the stage for the European Central Bank (ECB) to continue\ncutting interest rates in the months to come – unless new factors create\nuncertainty about inflation.\n\nNotably, prices of services were up only 3.2% in May versus a year earlier,\nsignaling that service inflation is no longer a hot topic in Europe. Prices of\nnon-energy industrial goods were up only 0.6% in May versus a year earlier.\n\nBy country, headline inflation in May was 2.1% in Germany, 0.6% in France, 1.9%\nin Italy, 1.9% in Spain, 2.8% in Belgium, and 3% in the Netherlands.\n\nGoing forward, there are several factors that could influence inflation, and\nconsequently monetary policy, in the Eurozone. First, the value of the euro has\nbeen rising as the US dollar has weakened. This reflects growing aversion to\nholding dollar-denominated assets on the part of global investors. A rising euro\nsuppresses Eurozone inflation. Second, energy prices have weakened, in part due\nto fears that trade wars will undermine global economic growth. This, too,\nsuppresses inflation. Third, the lagged effect of ECB monetary policy has\nsucceeded in anchoring expectations of inflation, thereby leading to lower\ninflation.\n\nFinally, the big unknown is the outcome of trade negotiations between the United\nStates and the EU. The former had proposed a 50% tariff on all imports from the\nEU. This led to an agreement to hold talks until early July. It is not known\nwhat concessions the United States is seeking from the EU in exchange for\nholding back on tariffs. Meanwhile, the United States has implemented steep\ntariffs on certain products (steel, aluminum, autos) and proposes to do so\nregarding other products. Thus, even if a deal is reached, these product-related\ntariffs will potentially invite retaliation by the EU, thus possibly boosting\ninflation in the Eurozone.\n\n * As expected, the European Central Bank (ECB) cut its  by 25 basis points.\n   Since June 2024, the ECB has cut rates by 200 basis points, far more than the\n   US Federal Reserve. This means that the interest rate gap between the United\n   States and the Eurozone has widened. Normally, this would have led to a\n   depreciation of the euro against the dollar. However, other factors, such as\n   the increasing aversion to holding dollars on the part of global investors,\n   have driven up the euro. The rise in the value of the euro is disinflationary\n   as it leads to lower import prices. Thus, the ECB is in a good place, able to\n   ease monetary policy without fear of igniting inflation.\n\nThe continuing easing of monetary policy by the ECB has been due to the sharp\ndecline in inflation and the weakness of the Eurozone economy. The European\nUnion reported recently that core inflation in May was only 2.3%, suggesting\nthat inflation has finally been beaten.\n\nGoing forward, there are reasons to expect a strengthening of the Eurozone\neconomy. First, the decline in interest rates will likely stimulate more credit\nmarket activity. Second, increased fiscal borrowing to fund defense spending\ncould have a stimulative impact on the economy. Finally, lower energy prices,\nwhich is a result of trade uncertainty, could unleash consumer spending.\n\nOn the other hand, trade uncertainty could undermine economic growth.\nNegotiations are taking place between the United States and EU, the results of\nwhich will determine the impact on the Eurozone economy. If the trade\nuncertainty intensifies, it would likely weaken growth while possibly weakening\ninflationary pressure. That, in turn, could lead to more aggressive easing of\nmonetary policy by the ECB. \n\nJAPANESE BIRTHS HIT A RECORD LOW\n\n * In Japan,  in 2024 fell to the lowest level since record-keeping began in\n   1899, down 5.7% from the previous year. This happened even though there had\n   been an increase in marriages. Government demographers had expected this\n   level of births, but not until 2038. Their expectation was based on the\n   trajectory of the number of women of child-bearing age, which has been\n   declining and will continue to decline. Yet the stunningly low number last\n   year means that the demographic decline of Japan is happening much faster\n   than previously expected.\n\nThe fertility rate is now 1.15 children per woman of child-bearing age. For the\npopulation to stabilize, the fertility rate would have to be 2.07 children per\nwoman of child-bearing age. \n\nAs a result of declining births and increasing deaths, the population of Japan,\nexcluding migration, fell by 919,237 last year. Meanwhile, the size of the labor\nforce has not yet begun to decline owing to increasing labor force participation\nby women and elderly. However, the labor force is expected to start declining in\n2035. The labor force was 69.25 million in 2023 and is now expected to reach\n62.87 million by 2050. A declining labor force means that, absent productivity\ngrowth, economic activity would decline. Moreover, with fewer people paying into\nthe pension system, and the number of retirees continuing to grow, there will be\nfurther stress on government finances.\n\nThere are two potential solutions to the demographic problem. One solution is\nincreased labor productivity, driven by the implementation of innovations\nthrough investment. Certainly, a shortage of labor, which will likely boost\nlabor costs, will provide companies with an incentive to invest in labor-saving\nand labor-augmenting technologies. The other solution is immigration. The\ngovernment has allowed more immigrants to come to Japan, but the numbers remain\nmodest. Only a sizable increase in immigration would make a difference.\n\n * \n * \n\nTHE EVER-CHANGING TRADE SITUATION\n\n * A lot happened recently regarding trade. First, the United States proposed a\n   steep tariff on imports from the European Union (EU). Then the United States\n   agreed to postpone the tariff while negotiations take place. Then a US\n   Federal Court ruled that most of the tariffs the US administration had\n   imposed this year were illegal. Yet an appellate court left the tariffs in\n   place while appeals take place. Moreover, the administration has various\n   remaining options regarding tariffs, thereby suggesting that the trade\n   uncertainty is not over. Here are the details of what happened.\n\n * Despite recent challenges in bond and equity markets, President Trump\n   recently said that he will impose a 50% tariff on all imports from the EU.\n   He  that talks with the EU were “going nowhere.” In addition, when asked what\n   deal he seeks with the EU, he said that he is “not looking for a deal” and\n   that “we’ve set the deal. It’s at 50%.” This suggests that the EU will face a\n   high hurdle to dissuade the president from imposing a new and very\n   significant tariff. On the other hand, US Treasury Secretary Bessent said\n   that “this is in response to the EU’s pace. I would hope that this would\n   light a fire under the EU.” His comment suggests that there could be a basis\n   for a deal.  \n\nHowever, a few days after the initial proposal, the US said that the  until July\n9 while the two sides engage in talks. There are likely two possible\nexplanations for the delay. One explanation is that the bond market reacted\nnegatively to the announcement of an intention to impose the 50% tariff on June\n1. The other is that President Trump held a productive call with EU Commission\nPresident Ursula von der Leyen. The postponement pleased bond and equity\ninvestors.\n\nYet many investors are making short-term bets rather than strategic bets. After\nall, nothing is yet certain. Meanwhile, the United States retains a 10% tariff\non all imports from the EU as well as some higher tariffs on specific products.\nThe EU remains prepared to impose punitive retaliatory tariffs on imports of\nspecific products from the United States if a deal cannot be reached.\n\nThe importance of this issue stems from the  that currently takes place between\nthe United States and the EU. In 2024, the United States imported US$606 billion\nin goods from the EU, more than from any individual country. The largest\ncategory of imports was pharmaceuticals, accounting for US$127 billion in\nimports. This is followed by automobiles at US$45 billion. Meanwhile, the United\nStates exported US$370 billion in goods to the EU. It is the gap between these\nnumbers that concerns the US administration, although bilateral trade imbalances\nare not important from an economic perspective.\n\nAs the talks proceed, it is not clear what the US seeks from the EU. The US is\nnot seeking low tariffs as they already exist. The average EU tariff on imports\nfrom the United States is only 2.7%. Rather, the United States has  a desire to\naddress non-tariff barriers, currency manipulation, and the size of the EU trade\nsurplus with the United States. Regarding non-tariff barriers, the United States\npoints to high value-added taxes (VATs) in Europe. Yet these are not non-tariff\nbarriers as they apply equally to imported and domestically produced goods.\nMoreover, there is little chance that governments in Europe will agree to reduce\ntheir VATs as part of a trade deal. The United States has also pointed to what\nit claims are discriminatory regulations.\n\nRegarding currency manipulation, it does not take place. The dollar-euro\nexchange rate is determined in the free market but is influenced by monetary\npolicies of the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank (ECB). The EU\ncannot commit to a specific ECB policy in its trade talks with the United States\nas the ECB is independent. Finally, the trade imbalance is determined in the\nfree market. The United States might ask the EU to commit to boost imports from\nthe United States, but the EU has no authority in this area other than to\nencourage member governments to boost procurement of goods from the US—perhaps\ndefense goods. As such, it is hard to see how an agreement that satisfies US\ndemands can be reached. On the other hand, a modest deal is not out of the\nquestion, especially if the United States wants to avoid uncertainty in\nfinancial markets.\n\nRecall that, on April 2, the United States proposed a 20% tariff on all imports\nfrom the EU but then postponed that tariff until July 9. Then, the United States\nproposed a 50% tariff to start on June 1. This has now been postponed until July\n9. This pattern of proposals and postponements creates a high degree of\nuncertainty for global companies, which must navigate the massive volume of\ntrans-Atlantic trade and cross-border investment. It is likely that major\nstrategic decisions are being placed on hold until there is greater clarity.\n\n * The US Court of International Trade, a relatively obscure but evidently\n   important panel, ruled that almost all the tariffs imposed by President Trump\n   since his term began are illegal. Does this mean that the trade war is over?\n   Hardly. The administration will appeal the ruling while an appellate court\n   has allowed the tariffs to remain in place while the appeal process proceeds.\n   Plus, even if the ruling is ultimately upheld, the administration has several\n   options available to implement tariffs. Still, investors reacted positively,\n   pushing up equity prices. Let’s look at the details.\n\nThe US administration had turned to the International Emergency Economic Powers\nAct (IEEPA) to rapidly implement significant tariffs. The IEEPA, which was\npassed in 1977, enables a president to quickly implement economic restrictions\non other countries during a national emergency. The law does not explicitly\nprovide for tariffs. The law was last used by President Biden to impose\nsanctions on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nIn this case, the Trump Administration had determined that there is a national\nemergency requiring rapid action stemming from the large US trade deficit.\nAlthough the law had never previously been used to impose tariffs, the\nadministration argued that tariffs on a wide range of countries were needed to\nreduce the trade deficit.\n\nThe , ruling unanimously, said that “the Worldwide and Retaliatory Tariff Orders\nexceed any authority granted to the President to regulate importation by means\nof tariffs.” It added that “the challenged Tariff Orders will be vacated and\ntheir operation permanently enjoined.” In other words, unless this ruling is\nreversed by a higher court, businesses will be able to obtain refunds for the\ntariffs already paid. Plus, existing tariffs will go away—at least until the\nadministration can find a different way to impose tariffs. Also, the ruling\napplies to the sweeping tariffs imposed on China, Mexico, Canada, and many other\ncountries. It does not apply, however, to tariffs imposed on specific products\nsuch as aluminum, steel, and automobiles as those were based on laws other than\nthe IEEPA.\n\nThe court explicitly rejected the argument about a national emergency, noting\nthat the United States has had persistent trade deficits for decades without any\nclear damage to the economy. Indeed, the United States has had strong economic\ngrowth with trade deficits while several surplus countries, such as Japan and\nGermany, have had slow economic growth. Moreover, the court  that the law\nrequires that, to utilize the law, the administration must be dealing with “an\nunusual and extraordinary threat.” It said that neither the trade deficit nor\nthe inflow of fentanyl meets this standard. The administration accused the court\nof overstepping its authority and being “activist.”\n\nWhat happens next? The administration has vowed to appeal the ruling. The next\nstep is the US Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia. After that is the\nUS Supreme Court, which has often deferred to presidents regarding the\ndetermination of national emergencies. On the other hand, the court might note\nthat the constitution provides Congress with the power to impose tariffs. If the\nadministration loses on appeal, there are several parts of the law governing\ntrade to which it can turn to impose tariffs.\n\nIn making its ruling,  that section 122 of the Trade Act enables the president\nto impose temporary tariffs to address “large and serious United States\nbalance-of-payments deficits.” This power is limited to tariffs of up to 15% and\nonly for 150 days, after which only the Congress can decide to continue the\ntariffs. This law might not appeal to the administration because of its\nlimitations. Moreover, the United States does not have a balance of payments\ndeficit, which is different from a trade deficit.\n\nThe tariffs on aluminum and steel were implemented on the basis of section 232\nof the Trade Act. This gives the president the authority to protect specific\nindustries that are under threat and are important for national security.\nImposing such tariffs requires a finding that follows an investigation. Thus, it\nis a slow process. Still, the administration has already launched such\ninvestigations regarding pharmaceuticals, aerospace, and other industries.\n\nAnother possibility is that the administration will turn to section 338 of the\nTariff Act of 1930. This law has never been used. However, it allows the\npresident to impose tariffs of up to 50% if a foreign country is engaged in\ndiscriminatory behavior against the United States. This can include “any\nunreasonable charge, exaction, regulation, or limitation.” Notably, the\npresident last week had proposed a tariff of 50% on the European Union, saying\nthat the EU had treated the United States unfairly. \n\nFinally, there is also section 301 of the Trade Act. This allows the\nadministration to impose tariffs and non-tariff barriers against countries that\nare deemed to have engaged in “practices that are deemed unreasonable,\nunjustifiable, or discriminatory and burden or restrict U.S. commerce.” However,\nit can be a time-consuming process that requires investigation. There are\ncurrently several 301 investigations under way. Section 301 was used by the\nfirst Trump Administration to impose a wide range of tariffs on China in 2018.\n\nThus, as is evident, the administration has several alternative avenues for\nimposing tariffs. Moreover, the administration could ask the Congress to amend\nthe law to give the president greater discretion. This is possible but not\nlikely. Such a change in law would require a super majority in the Senate, which\nwill not be forthcoming.\n\nFinancial market reaction to the court ruling was largely favorable. Equity\nprices initially jumped on expectations that the court ruling will render fewer\nand lower tariffs. Investors might also be betting that other countries will\ntake a more hardline stance in negotiations with the United States. For example,\nwill the EU now make significant concessions if the threat of US tariffs is\ntemporarily removed? It is not clear. Moreover, the recent pattern of\nthreatening or imposing high tariffs, followed by postponements and reversals,\nwould not work so well if the administration must follow the procedures embedded\nin laws other than the IEEPA.\n\nGROWING IMPACT OF TARIFFS AND TARIFF UNCERTAINTY\n\n * We now have early  of the impact of US tariffs. The US government reports\n   that, in April, imports of goods fell at the fastest pace on record. Recall\n   that, in the first quarter of 2025, imports had soared in anticipation of\n   tariffs, causing a decline in real GDP. With imports falling sharply in\n   April, and unless there is a commensurate decline in consumer and business\n   spending, this could mean a sharp acceleration in GDP in the second quarter.\n   On the other hand, we learned today that consumer spending on goods declined\n   in April (see below), thus potentially hurting economic growth in the second\n   quarter. In any event, the longer-term impact of tariffs on economic activity\n   will not likely be discernible until at least the third quarter. Now let’s\n   look at the details.\n\nIn April, imports of goods fell 19.8% from March, the largest monthly decline on\nrecord. This is in nominal, not inflation-adjusted, terms. By category, imports\nof industrial supplies were down 31.1%, imports of automotive vehicles were down\n19.1%, and imports of consumer goods were down 32.3%. Meanwhile, exports were up\nonly 3.4%. That means the trade deficit declined sharply in April, which is the\nadministration’s goal. However, unless there is a sharp increase in national\nsavings and/or a decline in inbound foreign investment, the longer-term trade\ndeficit will not decline. If, on the other hand, the economy weakens, leading to\na decline in savings, the trade deficit will indeed fall. But this would be at a\nconsiderable cost in terms of economic activity. Indeed, as discussed below,\nthere was a sharp increase in personal savings in April.\n\n * The  on personal income, personal consumption expenditures, personal savings,\n   and inflation for April. There were significant shifts likely owing to the\n   impact of tariffs. Let’s look at the details.\n\nThe personal savings rate increased from 4.3% in March to 4.9% in April, the\nhighest level since May 2024. This happened because spending increased far more\nslowly than personal income. Specifically, real (inflation-adjusted) personal\nincome was up 0.7% from March to April while real consumer expenditures\nincreased only 0.1%. Notably, real spending on goods was down 0.2%, including a\n0.8% decline in spending on durable goods. Real spending on non-durable goods\nwas up 0.1% while real spending on services was up 0.3%.\n\nWhy did spending on goods decline? One likely reason is that spending had soared\nin March in anticipation of tariffs. Thus, consumer demand had been sated early,\nthereby leading to a decline in demand. Another possibility is that consumers\nwere becoming cautious in their spending because they were increasingly worried\nabout the economic environment, as evidenced by  of consumer sentiment.\n\nAlso, the government reported data on the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of\ninflation, the personal consumption expenditures deflator (PCE-deflator). The\ndata show that, as of April, inflation was well contained. The overall\nPCE-deflator was up 2.1% from a year earlier, the lowest since September 2024.\nWhen volatile food and energy prices are excluded, the core PCE-deflator was up\n2.5% from a year earlier, the lowest since March 2021. In other words,\nunderlying inflation has fallen to a level last seen in the early days of the\npandemic. This represents significant progress. If not for tariffs, this would\nbe a signal that the Federal Reserve could safely continue easing monetary\npolicy. Yet tariffs are in place and prices are likely to accelerate, thereby\ncreating a difficult challenge for monetary policymakers.\n\nMeanwhile, the inflation data shows that goods prices fell 0.4% in April from a\nyear earlier, including a 0.3% decline in prices of durable goods and a 0.4%\ndecline in prices of nondurable goods. Plus, prices of services were up 3.3%,\nthe lowest since March 2021. For a long time, the principal concern of the\nFederal Reserve was persistent inflation in services. Now it appears that this\nis waning."}

Market participants were probably too sanguine over the past couple of\nweeks.

Unfortunately, this turned out\nto be false. Japan, South Korea and Malaysia got hit with a 25% rate. The silver\nlining is that these tariffs are only going to be effective 1st August, implying\nthat there are still three weeks for negotiations. Taken together, overly\nbuoyant sentiment has been pared down, but the shock factor is nowhere near as\nclose to what was seen on Liberation Day.  \n\n\n\nFrom a rates perspective, there is a need to price in some probability that\nTrump will follow through with the new tariffs. However, there is also a decent\nchance that this is part of Trump's \"escalate to de-escalate\" negotiation\ntactic. 2Y breakevens did rise by about 7bps yesterday reflecting higher\ninflation expectations. However, at 2.63%, these levels are still much lower\nthan where they were in early April (>3%). Moreover, the UST curve bear\nsteepened as opposed to bear flatten, which would have been a more logical\nexpression of stagflation impulse. Accordingly, there are other factors that are\ninfluencing US rates. A mix of pressure from long end JGBs and expectations that\nthe Fed will still cut rates over the coming year probably contributed to the\nsteepening overnight.\n\n\n\n\nEUGENE LEOW\n\nSENIOR RATES STRATEGIST - G3 & ASIA"}

Some of this is driven by\ncomfort that inflation has been muted despite the tariffs put in place in April.\nNotably, since peak fear in early April, 2Y breakevens have fallen by some 90\nbps to 2.48%. Inventory stocking and the sharing of costs may have delayed and\ndefrayed the impact of tariffs. And in any case, with oil prices low amidst\nspeculation of a dovish incoming Fed Chair, market participants took the chance\ndrive US yields lower. Current pricing is appropriate for a modest weakening in\nthe labour market and risks feels broadly balanced after the bounce in yields\nlast night. JOLT job openings jumped to 7.8mn in May against expectations of a\nsmall decline. Interestingly, there was also a pickup in quits and a reduction\nin layoffs.

The DXY extended its rise to 97.7 following Trump’s letters to\nJapan and South Korea, and later to another 12 countries, informing them that\nthe US would impose blanket tariffs close to the April 2 reciprocal tariffs on\ntheir exports to the US, effective August 1. However, the DXY eased to\n97.45-97.55 upon realisation that letters functioned as conditional extensions\nof the 90-day tariff pause that was originally set to expire on July 9. Trump\neffectively extended the negotiating window by another three weeks, allowing\ncountries to reach limited trade deals on America’s terms, with concessionary\ntariff rates like those offered to Vietnam.\n\nThe conditions outlined in the letters were a formal restatement of the demands\nthe Trump administration has been publicly articulating for months. Now put in\nwriting, the letters act as contractual deadlines instead of political rhetoric.\nThey also hardened Trump’s negotiating stance with a tone now direct, bilateral,\nand framed with final offers with specific consequences. Trump aims to shift the\nburden of action to foreign governments (“Here are our terms. Accept them or\ntariffs go up”) and set up a defensive narrative if the higher tariffs are\nimposed later (“We gave them every chance – even extended the deadline”).\n\nCompared to the 90-day tariff pause on April 9, this shorter 24-day extension to\nAugust 1 does not necessarily ease global trade tensions.  These written “take\nit or leave it” letters could be viewed as brinksmanship with compressed\ntimelines, hardened positions, and unclear outcomes that reintroduce uncertainty\nand volatility. Also, the August 1 deadline is still subject to the legal\nchallenges to the unresolved IEEPA tariffs (with a hearing on July 31). The\nletters do not resolve trade uncertainty and are likely to reinforce Fed Chair\nJerome Powell’s cautious wait-and-see stance, which should be clear in\ntomorrow’s FOMC minutes for the June 18 meeting. No one expects the Fed to lower\nrates at the July 30 FOMC meeting.\n\n\n\nOverall, we maintain the cautious tone outlined in our write-up yesterday. It\nremains uncertain if Trump’s letters will yield significantly more trade deals\nthan the handful of minor agreements secured over the past few months. For now,\nthe DXY Index could correct higher within the lower half of its descending price\nchannel to 98.2-98.6 (mid-point) this month, near two resistances marked by its\n20- and 50-day moving averages at 97.8 and 99.0, respectively.

The factors that depreciated the DXY Index\nby more than 10% over the past six months have faded.\n\nFirst, the waning US exceptionalism narrative that weighed on the USD has faded.\nUS equities (S&P 500) have rebounded to fresh record highs. The Atlanta Fed\nGDPNow model expects advance GDP growth (out on July 30) to recover to an\nannualized 2.6% QoQ saar in 2Q25 following a 0.5% contraction in 1Q25.\n\nSecond, last Thursday’s stronger-than-expected US jobs report dashed the\nmarket’s hope for an earlier Fed cut on July 30. The unemployment rate declined\nto 4.1% in June after holding steady at 4.2% for three months, bucking the Fed’s\nprojection, in the June Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), for it to rise to\n4.5% in 4Q25. The FOMC meeting minutes due on July 10 should reiterate Fed Chair\nJerome Powell’s view that tariffs will drive inflation higher in the coming\nmonths. Despite the New York Fed’s softer inflation expectation readings, FOMC\nmembers proceeded to lift their 4Q25 projection for core PCE inflation to 3.1%\nfrom 2.8%. in June’s SEP.\n\nAt the European Central Bank Forum in Sintra, major central banks collectively\nbecame less complacent about cooling inflation. They pivoted towards cautious\nmonitoring, signalling no overt moves and only data-driven decisions on interest\nrates. As seen over 2023-2024, such a synchronization towards “wait-and-see”\nguidance weakened the directional conviction in currency markets.\n\nThird, US President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill on\nIndependence Day, along with a USD5 trillion increase in the debt ceiling,\nthereby removing the risk of a US government debt default. US Treasury Secretary\nScott Bessent said he would not increase the sales of longer-dated debt in the\nnext several quarters.\n\nFourth, global trade uncertainty could resurface because the Trump\nadministration did not deliver the comprehensive trade deals by the July 9\nexpiration of the 90-day tariff pause. Meanwhile, the Court of International\nTrade’s legal case against Trump’s IEEPA-related tariffs remains unresolved,\nwith a hearing scheduled for July 31. In response, Trump plans to issue “tariff\nletters” to 12 countries, presenting them with non-negotiable “take it or leave\nit” offers or face higher tariff rates on August 1. Bessent added that the focus\nis on 18 nations that accounted for 95% of the trade deficit.\n\nFifth, Bessent expressed some discomfort about the recent speculation against\nthe USD’s global status. He dismissed the Chinese yuan’s prospects of replacing\nthe USD as a reserve currency due to its non-convertibility on the capital\naccount. He also noted that some EU policymakers have become wary of the\nEUR/USD’s strength near 1.20, which has partially offset some of the enthusiasm\ngenerated by ECB President Christine Lagarde’s push for a larger international\nrole for the EUR.\n\nHowever, if US bond yields rise due to debt and inflation concerns, and stocks\nstart giving back gains amid tariff-related growth worries, the USD could resume\nits downtrend.\n\n\nQuote of the Day\n”Long run is a misleading guide to current affairs.

While\noverall sentiment toward the greenback remains negative following its 10%\ndecline in 1H25, volatility has increased as markets become more sensitive to US\nlabour and inflation data that shape Fed cut expectations. The passage of\nTrump’s One Big Beautiful Bill adds to the USD’s vulnerability by posing two\nthreats: it links long-term US bond yields to mounting concerns over\nunsustainable US debt and shifts Trump’s attention toward undermining Fed Chair\nJerome Powell in pursuit of aggressive Fed cuts heading into this fall.\n\nDXY initially jumped from 96.8 to 97.4 after June’s US nonfarm payrolls\nincreased to 147k, bucking the widespread anticipation for a decline to 106K\nfrom 144K (revised from 139K) in May. The unemployment rate also fell to 4.1%\ninstead of the expected rise to 4.3% from 4.2% in May. The US Treasury 10Y yield\nsurged to 4.36% from 4.26% as the futures market pulled back the odds for a July\nFed cut to less than 5% from 25% a day earlier. \n\nHowever, the DXY could not break above 97.4 and retreated to 96.9 over the next\nhour. Upon closer inspection, the better-than-expected NFP was masked by an\nincrease in government hirings. Private sector payrolls declined to 74K in June\nfrom 137K in May, consistent with the 33K private sector jobs lost in the ADP\nEmployment report. The ISM Services Employment Index also declined to 47.2 in\nJune from 50.7 in May. Average weekly earnings slowed to 3.7% YoY in June, its\nlowest level in 11 months. Hence, the futures market maintained a two-thirds\nchance for a Fed cut in September.\n\nNonetheless, the increase in the overall ISM Services PMI to 50.8 from 49.9,\ndriven by better new orders, was enough to lift the DXY to a higher 97.1-97.2\nrange for the rest of the session. However, the DXY could not break above this\nrange despite US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s rejection of this year’s USD\ndecline as a reflection of its diminished global status, and the idea that the\nCNY or the EUR could replace the USD as the dominant reserve currency. The\ngreenback could not shake off unsustainable debt worries, as House Republicans\ncaved in to approve Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, which would also lift the\nfederal debt ceiling by USD5 trillion. The US Treasury 30Y yield held firm in a\nhigher 4.835-4.865% range after its jump from 4.79% on the\nstronger-than-expected nonfarm payrolls.\n\nTrade uncertainties linger as the US enters its Independence Day long weekend.\nBessent acknowledged that Japan’s Upper House elections on July 20 may constrain\ntrade talks. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned that a\nfinal EU-US trade deal was impossible before the July 9 deadline, with both\nsides aiming for a tentative agreement instead. Commerce Secretary Howard\nLutnick announced that tariffs could increase for countries without deals.\nAlthough Bessent warned that tariffs could rise back up to April 2 levels, he\nadded that countries negotiating in good faith could have their tariffs remain\nat the 10% baseline, with Washington looking to finalize more trade deals by\nLabor Day, which falls on September 1.\n\nFears of Fed independence will continue to cast a long shadow over the USD. With\nhis OBBB clearing Congress, Trump should increase pressure on Powell for\naggressive rate cuts, i.e., from 4.25-4.50% to 1%. Bessent affirmed that Trump\nwould decide this fall on who will assume the Fed Chair after Jerome Powell’s\nterm ends in May 2026. Appointing a shadow Fed Chair could serve as a powerful\ntactic to undermine the sitting chair and exert informal control over monetary\npolicy. For example, the futures markets see the Fed lowering rates every\nquarter between 3Q25 and 3Q26.

With markets heading into the US Independence\nDay long weekend, another bout of volatility is likely.\n\nYesterday’s intra-day volatility during the US session revealed how the USD was\npulled in opposite directions.\n\nThe DXY initially tumbled from 97.1 to 96.8 following a shocking June ADP\nemployment report, which showed 33K private sector job losses, far below\nexpectations for a 98K gain, compared to the modest 29K increase in May.\nHowever, the soft data boosted expectations for an earlier Fed cut, which in\nturn lifted the S&P 500 to a fresh record high and helped the DXY rebound to an\nintra-day high of 97.2. On the one hand, new highs in US stocks undermines the\nwaning US exceptionalism narrative that sent the DXY depreciating by 7% in 2Q25.\nOn the other hand, the greenback cannot brush off the downside risks Trump\nstepping up efforts to push for aggressive Fed cuts and Fed Chair Jerome\nPowell’s resignation.\n\nIn the second half of the US session, the DXY later gave back these gains,\nfalling back to 96.8 after US President Donald Trump announced a preliminary\nlimited trade deal with Vietnam. Markets have come to recognize Trump’s approach\n– whether in trade or geopolitics – follows an “escalate-to-deescalate” strategy\naimed at forcing parties towards trade agreements or ceasefires. Securing trade\ndeals is central to advancing Trump’s MAGA (Make America Great Again) agenda of\nrestoring US manufacturing dominance and expanding access for US exports. This\ninherently implies a weaker USD bias to improve America’s export\ncompetitiveness, one reinforced by his push for aggressive Fed cuts.\n\nHence, markets can expect a third day of volatility ahead if the long weekend in\nthe US. After the shockingly weak ADP report, markets are bracing for downside\nsurprises in today’s nonfarm payrolls, i.e., below 100K or negative readings.\nGiven the US-Vietnam trade deal and the looming July 9 deadline for the\nreciprocal tariff pause, markets are also alert to similar trade announcements\nwith India and the European Union. Negotiations are progressing with South\nKorea, Canada, and Thailand but they may need extensions. The push to get\nTrump’s One Big Beautiful Bill passed before the Independence Day (soft)\ndeadline adds another later of uncertainty. A last-minute passage of the bill\ncould not be ruled out, an outcome that could cement the fiscal deficit\nfinancing worries weighing on the USD. Don’t be surprised if Trump takes another\nswipe at Powell during the Independence Day celebrations.\n\n\n\nOur view remains unchanged.

The 90-day\nreprieve saw a tentative stabilisation in sentiments, weakened the US dollar,\nperked global financial markets and delayed a knock-on impact on the real\neconomies. There has been a constant trickle of on-again off-again trade deal\ndiscussions and counter-tariff announcements. Trading partners have endured a\nbusy few weeks of travelling the Asia-Washington corridor, seeking relief from\ntariffs, including sector specific rates, offering import concessions in return.\nOver the weekend, US Commerce Secretary Lutnick said that US tariff rates might\nbe set this week, but will come into effect on 1 August.  \n\nThree trade deals have been concluded (at the time of writing), with the UK,\nChina and Vietnam. What were the telling parts of these deals?\n\nFirstly, a baseline tariff rate stays, ranging from 10% to 30%. Details on the\nexact concessions and product-wise relaxations are scant, beyond few key talking\npoints.\n\nSecondly, an implicit acknowledgement that partners will buy more from the US\nhas been built in, aimed at reducing the trade gap and addressing few non-trade\nmeasures.\n\nNext, efforts have been made to rein in transshipment flows, likely targeted at\nChina’s move to channel trade through the region to tap the tariff differential\n(for instance, 40% levy on any goods deemed to be transhipped through Vietnam)\nevident in the recent months (see chart). We also note that regional countries\nhave initiated counteraction on their end, for instance India tightening rules\nof origin documentation and Vietnam creating a central agency to issue and\nverify origin documents.\n\nAdd to this, calls to be tolerant of currency appreciation by the region vs the\nUS dollar was presumably also in the mix, even if not explicitly mentioned.\nLastly, assurances of an increase in investments into the US.\n\nWhere to from here? In addition to being a risk mitigation exercise, which way\nthe tariff announcements go will have material impact on markets and economies.\nWe draw up scenarios for Liberation Day 2.0 (changes to take effect in August).\n\n\n\nApril redux (35%) - this scenario assumes that the US administration reinstates\nthe reciprocal tariffs with the rate determined by level of perceived\ncooperation in trade deals by partners. Few of the 10-15 countries with whom\ndiscussions are nearing the final leg might get temporary reprieve. Impact:\nUnless details are readily available, this might sow confusion, and hurt\nconfidence.Summer discount (25%) – Preset reduction of the reciprocal rates (for\ninstance, half) announced back in April, with the baseline minimum rate of 10%.\nWashington may continue to negotiate with countries in the coming weeks, which\nmight could see further finetuning of the bilateral rates. Impact: This will\nkeep markets’ ears close to the ground but not be viewed as an outright\nnegative.Kick the can (probability assigned 20%) – an extension of 30-90 days\nciting the long list of countries that are still in wait to finalise details and\nconcessions for the US (1 Aug kick-in reflects this). Impact: Status quo for\nmarkets and economic outlook.Sector-specific action (15%) – this assumes a\ncontinuation of the current 10% baseline on most of the countries and higher 30%\non China, while focusing more on sector specific moves, which the US might deem\nsensitive, strategic or technologies that can be put to dual-use. Action on\nsemiconductors, electronics, and pharmaceuticals, which were left out of the\ntariff umbrella might be considered. Action on auto, steel and aluminium are\nbound to continue. Impact: Part relief as a sharp increase in tariff rates are\nallayed, but countries with exposure to these specific sectors will be impacted.\nFor instance, Asian countries are key suppliers of semiconductors to the US,\nwith Malaysia leading the pack, followed by Taiwan, Vietnam, and South\nKorea.Reconciliation (5%) – this would be the most optimistic but least probable\nscenario where the US government strikes a conciliatory tone and counts on\nbilateral trade deals to gradually improve its trade balance.\n\n\nAfter a roller coaster ride in wake of the April’s Liberation Day, equities have\nsince recovered, notwithstanding an escalation in Middle east tensions, US\nfiscal concerns, and tariff uncertainty, in the interim. S&P 500 is near a fresh\nhigh, while regional bond/equity markets have attracted diversification inflows.\nMuch of the complacency is evident in options markets, signalling traders are\nnot betting on a significant shake up post Liberation Day 2.0.\n\nAdopting a cautious but non-recessionary stance, DBS US economist has maintained\nthe GDP forecast at 1.5% YoY, along with a 50bp cut from the US Fed in 2H25 and\nanother 50bp cut in 2026. DBS currency strategist maintains that while the USD\nretains its structural advantages, there are early signs of erosion that leads\nto a slow and steady decline in its global dominance. For Asia, these scenarios\n(barring the most optimistic option) are likely to impact regional and trade\noutlook, with some concern already baked into a stronger first half of exports\non frontloading, setting the stage for a weak 2H25.

US nonfarm payroll came in at 147k in June, surpassing both May’s upwardly\nrevised figure of 144k and market expectations of 106k. Unemployment rate\ndeclined to 4.1% in June from 4.2% in May, defying consensus forecast that\nanticipated a rise to 4.3%. We believe the stronger-than-expected labour report\nhas diminished the likelihood of the Fed’s earlier rate cut.\n\nDuring the European Central Bank’s annual forum in Sintra, Portugal on 1 Jul,\nFed Chair Jerome Powell appeared to have softened his stance about an earlier\nJuly cut. However, Powell has maintained the view that US inflation would be\nhigher in the coming months because of tariffs. Hence, the CPI data on 15 Jul\nwill also be important. According to median expectations, headline and core\ninflation are expected to increase to 0.3% m/m in June from 0.1% in May. Before\nthat, the New York Fed’s inflation expectation gauges, due on 8 Jul, will be key\nin reassuring that the inflationary impact of the tariffs will be one-off.\n\nGiven the US-Vietnam trade deal on 2 Jul and the looming 9 Jul deadline for the\nreciprocal tariff pause, markets are also alert to similar trade announcements\nwith India and the European Union. Negotiations are progressing with South\nKorea, Canada, and Thailand but they may need extensions.\n\nThe House of Representatives passed Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” by a vote\nof 218 to 214 on 3 Jul, just in time for the 4 Jul deadline that he set. The\nlegislation extends Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and delivers new tax breaks that he\npromised during his 2024 presidential campaign (e.g. boosting military spending\nand funding a mass migrant deportation drive). It also cuts health and food\nsafety net programs and reverses much of Biden’s green energy incentives. With\nfiscal deficit set to widen, we believe this outcome could lead to fiscal\ndeficit financing worries.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: US unemployment rate\n\nSource: Bloomberg, DBS\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the PDF to read the full report which includes insights on Vietnam,\nIndia, Indonesia, and Thailand."}

Portfolios are subject to\nmarket risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned\nby the portfolio will decline and that the value of portfolio shares may\ntherefore be less than what you paid for them.  Market values can change daily\ndue to economic and other events (e.g. natural disasters, health crises,\nterrorism, conflicts and social unrest) that affect markets, countries,\ncompanies or governments. It is difficult to predict the timing, duration, and\npotential adverse effects (e.g. portfolio liquidity) of events.  Accordingly,\nyou can lose money investing in this portfolio. Please be aware that this\nstrategy may be subject to certain additional risks. Active Management: in\npursuing the Portfolio’s investment objective, the Adviser has considerable\nleeway in deciding which investments to buy, hold or sell on a day-to-day basis,\nand which trading strategies to use. The success or failure of such decisions\nwill affect performance. There is the risk that the Adviser’s asset allocation\nmethodology and assumptions regarding the Underlying Portfolios may be incorrect\nin light of actual market conditions and the Portfolio may not achieve its\ninvestment objective. Share prices also tend to be volatile and there is a\nsignificant possibility of loss. The portfolio’s investments in commodity-linked\nnotes involve substantial risks, including risk of loss of a significant portion\nof their principal value. In addition to commodity risk, they may be subject to\nadditional special risks, such as risk of loss of interest and principal, lack\nof secondary market and risk of greater volatility, that do not affect\ntraditional equity and debt securities. Currency fluctuations could erase\ninvestment gains or add to investment losses. Fixed-income securities are\nsubject to the ability of an issuer to make timely principal and interest\npayments (credit risk), changes in interest rates (interest-rate risk), the\ncreditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (market risk). In a\nrising interest-rate environment, bond prices may fall and may result in periods\nof volatility and increased portfolio redemptions. In a declining interest-rate\nenvironment, the portfolio may generate less income. Longer-term securities may\nbe more sensitive to interest rate changes. Equity and foreign securities are\ngenerally more volatile than fixed income securities and are subject to\ncurrency, political, economic and market risks. Equity values fluctuate in\nresponse to activities specific to a company. Stocks of small-capitalization\ncompanies carry special risks, such as limited product lines, markets and\nfinancial resources, and greater market volatility than securities of larger,\nmore established companies. The risks of investing in emerging market countries\nare greater than risks associated with investments in foreign developed markets.\nExchange traded funds (ETFs) shares have many of the same risks as direct\ninvestments in common stocks or bonds and their market value will fluctuate as\nthe value of the underlying index does. By investing in exchange traded funds\nETFs and other Investment Funds, the portfolio absorbs both its own expenses and\nthose of the ETFs and Investment Funds it invests in. Supply and demand for ETFs\nand Investment Funds may not be correlated to that of the underlying securities.\nDerivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses\nand may have a potentially large negative impact on the portfolio’s performance.\nA currency forward is a hedging tool that does not involve any upfront payment.\nThe use of leverage may increase volatility in the Portfolio.\n\nIMPORTANT DISCLOSURES:\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results. The returns referred to in\nthe audio are those of representative indices and are not meant to depict the\nperformance of a specific investment.\n\nThere is no guarantee that any investment strategy will work under all market\nconditions, and each investor should evaluate their ability to invest for the\nlong-term, especially during periods of downturn in the market.\n\nA separately managed account may not be appropriate for all investors. Separate\naccounts managed according to the particular Strategy may include securities\nthat may not necessarily track the performance of a particular index.

Notably, electronics\nexports surged 23.5% YoY in April, nearly double the revised March reading of\n12.2% YoY.\n\nThe April overall NODX and electronics NODX prints were the strongest since July\nand November 2024 respectively.\n\nNon-electronics NODX also grew by 9.3% YoY in April, up from the 3.7% YoY in\nMarch, aided by non-monetary gold (80.4%) and structures of ships & boats and\nspecialised machinery (7.2%).\n\nFor electronics NODX, the April outperformance was driven by PCs (124.3% YoY),\nICs (23.3%) ad disk media products (33.0%). This could be attributed to the\nongoing front-loading, especially after the Trump administration exempted\nseveral electronic products from reciprocal tariffs. In addition, reciprocal\ntariff on Singapore’s exports to the US was set at a minimal 10% (the lowest\nrate amongst the reciprocal tariffs imposed).\n\nAmong the top 10 NODX markets, only China and Malaysia saw a contraction in\nApril. April NODX grew by at least a double-digit YoY pace to 5 of the top 10\nmarkets. The five were Indonesia (111.2% YoY due mainly to structures of ships &\nboats, non-monetary gold and PCs), Taiwan (47.4% YoY due mainly to specialised\nmachinery, ICs and measuring instruments), South Korea (38.1% YoY due to\nspecialised machinery, ICs and PCs), Hong Kong (26.4% YoY) and Thailand (10.5%\nYoY).\n\nIn contrast, NODX to the US slowed sharply from 6.2% YoY in March to 1.2% in\nApril and was broad based across electronics NODX (0.8% versus 11.3% previously)\nand non-electronics (1.3% versus 5.4% previously). Meanwhile, NODX to Malaysia\nalso moderated to contract by 1% YoY in April (March: 12.4%), dragged down by\nelectronics (-0.5% versus 25.9% previously) and non-electronics (-1.4% versus\n3.7% previously).\n\nThe worst NODX performing market was China which sank again by 17.0% YoY in\nApril, although this was milder than the 29.5% slump in March – interestingly\nthe non-electronics NODX slump (-18.0%) was worse than the electronics NODX\ncontraction (-9.6%) which could be reflective of the weak domestic consumption\ndemand.\n\nWhile the outcome of tariff negotiations between the US and its trading partners\nis still pending during the 90-days suspension of reciprocal tariffs, the\nsoftening of NODX to the US market requires monitoring. The US has announced a\ntariff deal with the UK, lowered tariffs on Chinese exports during a 90-day\ntruce period and it is conducting various ongoing trade negotiations with many\nother countries. As a result, risk sentiments have turned a shade brighter. This\ncould be a relief window where frontloading potentially continues until there is\nbetter clarity. However, it remains to be seen if a more permanent trade deal\ncan be reached between the US and China during the 90-day period.\n\nOur full-year 2025 NODX forecast for Singapore remains at a range of -1% to 1%\nYoY. To reiterate, the WTO has significantly downgraded its global merchandise\ntrade growth for this year from 3% to 0.2% YoY, stemming largely from escalating\ntrade tensions including the intensifying US-China trade war which could lead to\nan expected 81% drop in their bilateral merchandise trade, ceteris paribus\n(i.e., other things being equal).\n\nNotably, North America’s trade is projected to slump by 12.6% YoY (2024: 2.3%),\nwhile that for Asia will slow to just 1.6% (2024: 8.0%). If there is broader\nspillover of policy uncertainty, the WTO tips an even sharper drop of 1.5% YoY\nin 2025, although it sees a rebound to 2.5% in 2026. The WTO also warned that\nsuch economic decoupling could cut global GDP by up to 7% in the long term.\n\nAdditionally, the shift from a rules-based to a deals-based trading system has\nintroduced heightened unpredictability and potentially undermines global\neconomic stability. Even if a US-China trade deal is ultimately negotiated,\nthere are still potential sectoral tariffs on semiconductors and others to come,\nwhich could be stumbling blocks to the road ahead. Moreover, the high NODX base\nin 2H2024 is another issue to contend with, as a stronger 1H2025 NODX growth\ncould give way to a sharper moderation ahead in 2H2025."}
{"article_title": "Challenging times ahead", "publish_date": "2025-06-01", "url": "https://www.ocbc.com//premier-banking/market-insights/global-outlook", "source": "OCBC", "content": "The Trump administration’s volatile economic, fiscal, trade and foreign policies\nare undermining faith in US assets. We see the US Dollar and US Treasuries\nweakening over the long term as investors rotate to Europe and Asia.\n\nEli Lee\nManaging Director,\nChief Investment Strategist,\nChief Investment Office,\nBank of Singapore Limited\n\nFinancial markets face a challenging outlook despite the US and China agreeing\nto reduce extra tariffs to 30% and 10% respectively and the US Court of\nInternational Trade ruling against some of the Trump administration’s new\ntariffs.\n\nImportantly, US new baseline 10% tax on all imports remains in place as does the\nTrump administration’s 9 July deadline to impose further sweeping reciprocal\ntariffs unless dozens of countries agree to new trade deals.\n\nWe thus see three key risks to the economic outlook.\n\nFirst, higher US tariffs will result in a supply shock to the US economy. We\nexpect US growth to halve this year, inflation to rise and the Fed, faced with\nstagflation, to limit interest rate cuts in 2025 to ensure inflation does not\nbecome unmoored from its 2% target.\n\nSecond, the rest of the world is set to suffer a demand shock from US tariffs.\nBut we expect interest rate cuts and fiscal stimulus in Europe and Asia to\ncushion growth.\n\nWe therefore see activity weakening in major emerging economies ‒ including\nChina and India ‒and staying subdued in the Eurozone and UK as our table of GDP\ngrowth forecasts below shows. But we do not see severe crises this year, as\ngovernments in the rest of the world loosen monetary and fiscal policies and\nstrike trade deals with the US to reduce the Trump administration’s new tariffs.\n\nThird, the Trump administration’s volatile economic, fiscal, trade and foreign\npolicies are undermining faith in US assets. We thus see the US Dollar and US\nTreasuries (UST) weakening over the long term, as investors rotate to Europe and\nAsia. For example, we think 10Y UST yields will settle at higher levels around\n5% and the greenback will fall further to 1.23 against the EUR over the next 12\nmonths.\n\nUS: A patient Fed\n\nThis year, the Federal Reserve has paused its interest rate cuts while it waits\nfor more clarity on the economic outlook. In May, the Federal Open Market\nCommittee (FOMC) left its fed funds rate at 4.25-4.50% for the third meeting in\na row and signalled it remains in no rush to change interest rates while\nawaiting clarity on the Trump administration’s tariffs and fiscal policies.\n\nThe FOMC’s meeting statement was altered to highlight uncertainty had increased\nsince President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on 2 April:\n‘uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further.’\n\nThe FOMC also warned that risks had increased to its twin goals of achieving\nstable prices and maximum employment: ‘the Committee is attentive to the risks\nto both sides of its dual mandate and judges that the risks of higher\nunemployment and higher inflation have risen.’\n\nThird, Chairman Jerome Powell stressed the Fed was well positioned to keep\ninterest rates at current levels while waiting for more clarity on the outlook\nbefore acting: ‘we don’t think we need to be in a hurry. We think we can be\npatient. We are going to be watching the data. The data may move quickly or\nslowly. But we do think we are in a good position where we are to let things\nevolve and become clearer in terms of what should be the monetary policy\nresponse.’\n\nWe continue to see the Fed leaving interest rates unchanged for most of this\nyear as steep US tariffs cause inflation to rise. We expect only one 25bps rate\ncut at most, which will be likely in 2025.\n\nWe thus keep our view that with little Fed rate cuts, higher inflation from\nsteeper tariffs and a worsening US budget deficit, long-term UST yields are\nlikely to rise sharply. At the same time, we continue to see the USD weakening\nfurther as global investors recoil from US policymaking.\n\nOur key macroeconomic forecasts for the fed funds rate remain above 4.00%\nthroughout 2025, for 10Y UST yields to increase to 5.00% and for the EUR to\nreach 1.23 over the next 12 months.\n\nChina: Will slow but not falter under US tariffs\n\nChina’s economic outlook has improved this year after two key developments in\nMay.\n\nFirst, following negotiations in Switzerland, the US and China agreed to slash\nthe extra tariffs each country has imposed on each other this year. The 90-day\nreprieve will last until 10 August. But the trade truce has scaled back tariffs\nmuch earlier and deeper than investors had expected.\n\nThis year’s additional US tariffs on Chinese goods will fall from an extreme\n145% to 30%, comprising the 20% additional tariffs imposed by the Trump\nadministration to deter fentanyl supplies, and the new 10% baseline Washington\nset in April on all US imports. Similarly, China’s extra tariffs on US exports\nwill fall from 125% to 10%. Thus, overall US tariffs on Chinese goods now stand\naround 40% and China’s on US exports just under 30%.\n\nSecond, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) announced its first interest rate cut\nsince September. Its 7-day reverse repo rate will fall 10bps to 1.40%. Reserve\nrequirement ratios (RRR) will also fall 50bps. Large banks will thus need to\nretain 9.00% of deposits from 9.50% before.\n\nThe combination of an early trade truce and early rate cuts supports our view\nthat China’s economy will slow this year but not falter under US tariffs. We\nthus keep our forecast for GDP growth to ease from 5.0% in 2024 to 4.2% in 2025.\n\nEurope: Easing monetary policy\n\nWe expect the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England (BoE) to keep\non reducing interest rates this year to support lacklustre GDP growth of around\n1.0% in both the Eurozone and the UK.\n\nIn contrast to the US, which is set to suffer higher inflation due to the supply\nshock from its tariffs, the Eurozone and the UK will see inflation ease from the\ndemand shock of lower US purchases of Europe’s exports. We therefore expect the\nECB and the BoE to keep cutting interest rates this year to 1.75% and 3.75%\nrespectively to the benefit of Europe’s financial markets.\n\nAt the same time, we expect the falling USD globally to cause the EUR and GBP to\nkeep rallying 1.23 and 1.44 respectively over the next 12 months. We thus see\nstronger domestic currencies also causing the ECB and BoE to keep lowering\ninterest rates to cushion growth from higher US tariffs this year.\n\nJapan: A cautious BoJ\n\nIn contrast to the Fed, PBoC, ECB and BoE, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) is the one\nmajor central bank that has been raising interest rates over the past year,\nhelping the JPY recover from its four-decade lows of 162 against the USD reached\nin 2024.\n\nWe expect the BoJ will keep on gradually raising rates in 25bps steps roughly\nonce every six months. Currently, the BoJ’s overnight call rate is still very\nlow at just 0.50% while core inflation has been above its 2% target since 2022.\nBut at its latest meeting on 1 May, the central bank gave no indication when it\nwould next lift interest rates given the uncertain outlook for global trade.\n\nWe expect the BoJ to keep its rate hikes paused until Japan signs a trade deal\nwith the US. Once, the BoJ has clarity on exports, we think it will hike again\nenabling the JPY to rise further to 132 against the USD over the next 12 months."}

During times of uncertainty, we would favour defensive names\nwhich have strong pricing power and exhibit resilient earnings.\n\nOver the next 12 months, we remain positive on equities in Europe and Asia\nex-Japan.\n\nOngoing policy uncertainty in the US is making non-US investments more\nappealing, with Europe standing out due to its supportive government spending,\ncentral bank policies, and relatively low equity valuations.\n\nIn Asia (excluding Japan), we continue to prefer equities in Hong Kong/China,\nSingapore, and the Philippines.\n\nUS: Relief rally on reduced tail risks\n\nThe S&P 500 Index saw a relief rally in May, rising above pre-Liberation Day\nlevels, though it is still below this year’s highest point. This rebound was\nmainly due to quicker-than-expected progress in trade talks, especially between\nthe US and China, which helped ease fears of a recession. Although Trump briefly\nreignited concerns by threatening to raise tariffs on the EU from 20% to 50% on\n1 June, he later backed down and extended the deadline to 9 July.\n\nDespite this, we expect market volatility to remain high until firm trade\nagreements are reached, as policy shifts could still cause sharp market\nmovements.\n\nLooking ahead, economic growth may pick up from late 2025. Trump’s pro-growth\npolicies—like deregulation and tax cuts—could gain attention again, particularly\nwith the 2026 US midterm elections approaching. However, concerns about\ngovernment debt may weigh on the US Dollar, which could support company earnings\nto some extent, though rising long-term yields might offset this.\n\nIn the short term, with no clear drivers for growth, we expect markets to stay\nwithin a narrow range. We’re keeping our S&P 500 Index targets unchanged, with a\nbase case of 5,800 and a bullish scenario of 6,200.\n\nEurope – A safer haven\n\nUnless there’s a major rise in trade tariffs or a global slowdown, Europe’s\neconomy is expected to strengthen from 2026. This growth will likely be\nsupported by:\n\nCompared to regions like the US, Europe benefits from more supportive economic\npolicies and relatively low stock valuations. We believe the region’s potential\nfor bold reforms and coordinated action is underappreciated. If external risks\ngrow, Europe may respond with stronger measures that could further boost growth.\n\nThe easing of US-China trade tensions is also good news for Europe, which has\nstrong trade links with both countries.\n\nWe’ve raised our MSCI Europe Index targets to:\n\nOur base case assumes a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 16.5x and 6.5%\nearnings growth over the next 12 months.\n\nKey risks include renewed tariff threats, such as Trump’s proposed 50% tariff on\nEuropean goods. We continue to favour companies benefiting from defence and\ninfrastructure spending, as well as those involved in energy efficiency and the\ngreen transition.\n\nJapan: Neutral position still warranted\n\nJapanese equities have rebounded in both yen and US dollar terms. However, we’re\nkeeping a Neutral view, as the balance of risks and rewards remains even.\n\n \n\n \n\nThe MSCI Asia ex-Japan Index rebounded strongly in May 2025. We remain positive\non equities in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, and the Philippines, while keeping\nlower allocations in Thailand and South Korea.\n\nFollowing the US-China trade truce, we’ve raised our earnings forecasts and\nvaluation assumptions. As a result, our MSCI Asia ex-Japan Index targets are\nnow:\n\n \n\nChina/HK – De-escalation in trade tensions\n\nTensions between the US and China have eased after both countries agreed to roll\nback tariffs for 90 days. This is likely to boost market confidence in the short\nterm. However, it may also reduce the urgency for Chinese policymakers to\nintroduce further economic stimulus.\n\nAs a result, we now prefer offshore Chinese equities in the near term, given the\nimproved trade outlook and the possibility of slower stimulus measures. We've\nadjusted our MSCI China Index targets to:\n\nFirst-quarter 2025 results showed some improvement, with more companies beating\nearnings expectations. Although the MSCI China Index’s 2025 earnings forecast\nhas been revised down by 1% so far this year, there’s potential upside from\ngrowing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). Valuations remain attractive,\nwith the index trading at 10.3 times forward earnings—about 10% cheaper than the\nMSCI Emerging Markets Index.\n\nHong Kong has seen a rise in listings of top-tier mainland Chinese companies\nsince 3Q2024. So far this year, around 30 IPOs have raised HKD 77 billion. With\nover 120 IPOs in the pipeline, we expect a strong recovery in Hong Kong’s IPO\nmarket in 2025.\n\nGlobal Sectors: Dispersion driven by idiosyncratic factors\n\nOver the past month, the IT, Communication Services and Industrials sectors have\nled the pack, while the Healthcare sector has lagged the rest, dragged by\nconcerns over policy uncertainty ahead, particularly around pharmaceutical\ntariffs, the most favoured nation policy, and healthcare reforms in the US. We\nget the sense that generalist investors are adopting a wait-and-see approach\nwith regards to the Healthcare sector given the level of uncertainty currently.\n\nTech still broadly holding up\n\nWith the US reporting season almost wrapped up, investors have come away with a\nfew key takeaways. First, monetisation gains from generative AI are still\nsomewhat limited, with large advertising platforms being the main beneficiary at\nthis juncture. Second, cloud demand continues to remain robust on the back of\nboth cloud migration and AI spend, while supply challenges faced by some should\ngradually abate in the months ahead. Third, fundamental AI semiconductor demand\nremains strong, but broader concerns over export bans/controls remain. Within\nChina tech, the key debate on increasing competition, especially in areas like\nfood delivery, continues to be a headwind, but valuations remain broadly\nattractive for many names at this juncture.\n\nDefence stocks – the New Guard\n\nAs for Industrials, the sector has been supported by more positive sentiment on\nAerospace and Defence stocks. Interest in the aerospace and defence sector\ncontinues unabated, supported by\n\nWe believe there are structural shifts taking place which lend support to a\nconstructive longer-term view for names in the defence sector, though valuations\nhave also risen to reflect brighter prospects. US names, however, have not\nre-rated significantly in comparison to other global peers and there is room for\ncatch-up especially if favourable developments relating to defence budgets are\nconfirmed."}

As we expect\ntariffs and trade-related headlines to inject volatility in the near future, we\ncontinue to retain a defensive posture across DM and EM, with a preference for\nIG over HY.\n\nRates and US Treasuries\n\nYields on UST rose over the month in a steepening move, driven by strong\neconomic data, inflation expectations, fiscal deficit concerns and cautious US\nFederal Reserve (Fed) stance. 2Y UST yields increased 14bps to 4.02% while 10Y\nUST yields advanced 31bps to 4.52%. 30Y UST yields briefly breached the 5%\npsychological mark, as a reflection of concerns over the fiscal trajectory not\nonly in the US, but also in Japan which contributed to sell-offs in long-end\nJapanese government bonds (JGB).\n\nInvestors are now focusing on US fiscal debt which is likely to increase further\nif the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” goes through the Senate. According to the\nCongressional Budget Office, the House of Representative’s version of the tax\nbill is expected to add about US$3.8t to the federal government’s US$36.2t in\ndebt over the next decade. Adding to the uncertainty on fiscal revenue is the US\nCourt ruling on Trump’s tariffs, which now raises questions on the supposed\nrevenues that the tariffs would bring.\n\nMarkets have been sensitive to the trajectory of US debt profile, exacerbated by\nMoody’s stripping of the US from its “AAA” credit rating. We believe elevated\npolicy uncertainty and fiscal concerns will continue to keep term premiums\nelevated.\n\nInvestors continue to look for policymakers to step in should long-end yields\ncontinue to rise. This includes potential buybacks, a reduction of supply along\nthe long-end (in favour of Treasury bills) or exempting USTs from the\ncalculation in Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR). These measures could provide\nrelief to the supply-demand imbalance along the long-end.\n\nHeightened policy uncertainty from the Trump administration is likely to keep\nrates volatile. We expect 10Y UST yields to hover in the 4.00-4.50% range in the\nnear term, but remain cautious over the long term given lingering concerns about\nfiscal deficits.\n\nWe remain Neutral on duration. The front-end will likely be anchored lower on\nexpectations of an interest rate cut. The long-end is vulnerable to term premium\nrisk but is skewed to the downside over the near term on growth concerns.\n\nDeveloped Markets (US, Europe, Japan and Australia)\n\nIG credits continued the grind tighter with spreads at 104bps, about 26bps from\nthe “Liberation Day” induced selloff. HY credits similarly tightened, with\nspreads at ~330bps, close to 100bps tighter from the April peak. While IG and HY\ncredits charted positive excess returns for the month, total returns were\ndragged down by negative UST returns.\n\nThe primary IG market continues to be active and the steady supply has been well\nabsorbed. This suggests that technicals remain robust as demand remains healthy\nwith investors attracted by higher overall yields.\n\nLower volatility in the equity and rates market have helped to stabilise\nsentiment. However, the rates trajectory and steepness of the yield curve\nremains a big risk. We remain watchful on global long-end rates which could\naffect risk appetite. In addition, corporates and consumers will have to\nnavigate an uncertain policy backdrop. That is likely to exert some downward\npressure on consumer and business spending.\n\nWe hold a Neutral position on DM IG bonds and an Underweight position on DM HY\nbonds.

The weaker global growth outlook and FX volatility could translate\ninto wider EM spreads over the next 12 months, but supportive technical factors\ncould be important mitigating considerations.\n\nAsia\n\nMarket sentiment improved in May after the tariff de-escalation, with credit\nspreads retracing the post-“Liberation Day” widening. However, fiscal concerns\nin DMs drove term premiums and long-end rates higher in May. This supported HY\noutperformance over IG during the month.\n\nFrontier sovereigns such as Sri Lanka and Pakistan led year-to-date (YTD)\nperformance within Asia. India, China and Macau also posted reasonably solid\nreturns while Malaysia, Thailand and Taiwan have generally lagged its peers due\nto their comparatively longer duration profile.\n\nWith YTD total returns of 2.3%, Asian credits have outperformed US credits but\nlagged the broader EM credit segment. Although we continue to expect company\nfundamentals and market technicals to remain largely supportive, rates\nvolatility and macro developments are likely to remain key drivers of\nperformance in 2025.\n\nAsia HY credit spreads have compressed 31bps YTD, while Asia IG spreads have in\ncontrast widened 17bps. This has brought the Asia HY/IG spread differential to\n~370bps – close to early 2021 levels, just before the series of defaults in\nChina HY through 2021-2023.\n\nWith credit spreads back to historical tight levels, that leaves limited room\nfor further compression and hence provides little buffer against macro\nuncertainty.\n\nAs such, we retain a quality basis in credits and reiterate that credit\nselection and duration positioning remain critical."}
{"article_title": "Gold: Sideways before rebounding", "publish_date": "2025-06-01", "url": "https://www.ocbc.com//premier-banking/market-insights/fx-and-commodities", "source": "OCBC", "content": "Gold may have pulled back from record highs, but we expect gold’s recent price\ndip will stimulate investment buying, as economic and geopolitical uncertainty\nlinger. Gold is likely to remain well supported by still elevated central bank\nbuying.\n\nVasu Menon\nManaging Director\nGlobal Wealth Management\nOCBC Bank\n\nPrecious metals\n\nGold has pulled back from record highs of US$3,500/oz in late April as tariff\nroll-back improved the US growth outlook, creating less of a demand for safe\nhavens like gold. High gold prices are also starting to hurt some demand,\nespecially jewellery. Nevertheless, we expect gold’s recent price dip will\nstimulate investment buying, as economic and geopolitical uncertainty linger.\nGold is likely to remain well supported by still elevated central bank buying.\n\nInvestor confidence in US fiscal health was shaken following Moody’s downgrade\nof the US sovereign credit rating. The recent failure of US government bonds to\nprotect against equity downside reinforces the merit of gold in long-term\nportfolios as gold is a valuable hedge against losses in fiscal and central bank\ncredibility. We see room for prices to rebound on a 6-12 month view if the USD\nweakens, or if fiscal concerns flare up again, driving more exchange traded fund\n(ETF) inflows. US activity data could likely roll over in the coming months as\nfront-loading unwinds and the sentiment shock dampens spending even as the soft\ndata start to stabilise. We think the trend towards a weaker USD remains intact\nand continue to favour gold as a protection against recession concerns,\nparticularly as we head into US labour market reports.\n\nOil\n\nOPEC+ agreed to a third consecutive production surge of 411k b/d in July despite\nreservations from Russia. A supply surge could add to downside oil price\npressures. But US oil inventories are tracking lower than last year, providing\ndownside protection to prices. Investors are also wary of upside risk as\nadditional US sanctions against Russia are now increasingly possible, further\nclouding the outlook for Russian oil and gas flows. The Russia-Ukraine conflict\nshows no signs of resolution, with diplomatic channels stalling. The US-Iran\nnuclear talks continue to inch forward, but with limited progress. A US-Iran\ndeal and easing sanctions could see Brent dipping below US$60/bbl while no deal\nand even escalatory action could see prices move back to US$70+/bbl.\n\nOil prices could decline further in the near term on supply concerns, but we\nmaintain our 12-month Brent forecast at US$65/bbl. We think sub-US$60/bbl Brent\nprices are not expected to be sustainable over the medium term as US shale\nsupply is likely to slow sharply in response to threats to the industry’s\nprofitability. OPEC+ might also decide to pause the unwinding of its cuts if\nprices decline to sub-US$60/bbl. Lower oil prices could also encourage a\nre-filling of US strategic petroleum reserve as early as August.\n\nCurrency\n\nThe US Dollar (USD) was choppy in May, driven by tariff de-escalation (as the US\nand China struck a temporary 90-day truce) and then re-escalation (US threatened\na 50% tariff on EU imports and a 25% tariff on smartphone makers if smartphones\nare not manufactured in America). President Trump also said that the US would\nsend letters to some of its trading partners to unilaterally impose new tariff\nrates. it remains unclear whether these new tariffs would be in addition to\nexisting ones or if they would supersede previous rates. Compounding these\ntariff uncertainties, Trump’s tax & spending bill and Moody's downgrade of the\nUS credit rating have also cast a long shadow over US fiscal sustainability. The\nCongressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the bill will add about US$3.8\ntrillion to the current US debt of US$36.2, over the next decade and the budget\ndeficit may widen to around 7% of GDP in the coming years. While this may\nstimulate growth in the short term, it raises concerns about the rising\ntrajectory of US debt and budget deficits in the medium term, as well as the\nassociated sovereign risk. These factors, combined with the policy\nunpredictability surrounding Trump’s tariffs and the erosion of US\nexceptionalism, could further undermine sentiment and confidence in the USD.\n\nThe Euro’s (EUR) performance was mixed in May, driven by dovish ECB rhetoric as\nwell as tariff uncertainties. As the time this was written, the EU and US were\nin the midst of trade negotiations despite the 50% tariff threat on EU goods.\nPotential repercussions if the 50% tariff goes ahead, may include a reduction in\nexports to the US, growth concerns in the EU and deeper ECB cuts to support\ngrowth. A potential trade deal between the EU and US may lead to the EUR\nretracing from its recent highs in the near term. But more importantly, if the\n“sell USD” trade remains alive amid diversification flows, alternative reserve\ncurrencies including the EUR may benefit.\n\nThe USD versus the Japanese Yen (JPY) i.e. USDJPY, had a rollercoaster ride in\nMay, driven by the unwinding of JPY-funded carry trades (as long-end yields\nsurged), month-end USD buy flows, tariff uncertainties, inflation data and BOJ\nrhetoric. The latest CPI report saw core inflation hit 3.5 per cent in April,\naccelerating at its fastest annual pace in more than two years due largely to a\n7 per cent surge in food costs. BOJ Governor Ueda called for vigilance over the\nrisks from food inflation. The hotter-than-expected CPI data keeps BOJ policy\nnormalisation hopes alive. While the timing of BOJ policy normalisation may be\ndeferred, it is not derailed. Fed-BOJ policy divergence and the USD\ndiversification theme should still support the USDJPY's broader direction of\nmovement to the downside. On tariff developments, Japan’s trade negotiator\nRyosei Akazawa concluded a third round of talks with US officials including\nJamieson Greer and Howard Lutnick over the 24-25 May weekend, while there is\nchatter that Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba may meet Trump in person in\nJune. Japanese officials appear keen to push for a trade deal by the next G7\nmeeting (mid-June), and there are expectations for some form of currency\nagreement as part of the deal. If it happens, it may result in a lower USDJPY\n(depending on the availability of details, as details of such currency\nagreements may or may not be disclosed).\n\nThe USD versus the Chinese onshore renminbi (RMB) i.e. USDCNY, traded lower in\nMay, aided by the 90-day trade truce between the US and China, while the softer\nUSD trend and the consistently lower USDCNY fix (but at a measured pace) saw\nboth the onshore USDCNY and the offshore USDCNH trade lower. We believe\npolicymakers are likely to still adopt a measured approach to appreciation like\nhow they took a measured approach when USDRMB was trading higher previously.\nMaintaining RMB stability is a key objective for policymakers at this point. Any\nsharp RMB appreciation may risk triggering exporters rushing to sell their USD\nholdings and that cycle (if it happens) may result in excessive RMB strength and\nvolatility, which is not desirable for policymakers. With regards to Asian\ncurrencies, the RMB does have some influence over the former’s direction, and\nthis is due to trade, investment and sentiment linkages. Our 30-day rolling\ncorrelation between Asian currencies and the RMB have also seen a pickup in\ncorrelation. If market perception bias about RMB is not negative (or positive\nlike now), then Asian currencies may even appreciate more than the RMB due to\nthe RMB’s relatively lower beta characteristic. Conversely, if the market\nperception about the RMB turns negative, then this may potentially restrain the\nappreciation path of Asian currencies and likely have a negative spillover\nimpact onto them.\n\nThe Singapore Dollar (SGD) has performed well this year, appreciating by about\n6% against the USD year-to-date (YTD) at the time of writing. This is despite\nmoves by the MAS to ease policy twice this year. The resilience was largely due\nto the SGD’s appeal as a safe haven (against the backdrop of Trump’s tariff\nuncertainties), solid fundamentals and a softer USD trend. This is also the\nstrongest YTD performance in the last 20 years. We continue to project a mild\ndegree of USDSGD downside, premised on: (i) tariff de-escalation with tariff\nimpact on regional growth largely manageable (i.e. no sharp recession); (ii)\nexpectations for the softer USD trend to continue and (iii) the Fed resuming its\neasing cycle in due course. Looking ahead, the earlier downgrades to growth and\ninflation projections for 2025 by the MAS, along with a highly uncertain\nexternal environment, suggests that the door remains open for further policy\neasing, should macroeconomic conditions deteriorate further. But April’s core\ninflation uptick also suggests that there may be no urgency to ease at the July\nMPC meeting for a third consecutive time after two back-to-back easing moves in\nApril and January this year. That said, we continue to monitor inflation, growth\nand tariff developments."}

Trump warned\nthat any retaliatory tariffs will trigger like-for-like US tariffs on top of the\nthreatened rate. The S&P 500 fell the most in three weeks, and the US dollar\nrose. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said more letters will be\nsent out in the coming days.\n\nHowever, Trump also signed an executive order on Monday extending the pause of\nthe “reciprocal” tariffs to 1 August, allowing more time for trade negotiations.\nHe added that the new deadline was “not 100% firm” and that the US remains open\nto further talks with countries offering additional concessions. Investor\nsentiment stabilized on Tuesday ahead of the US market open, with both Japan's\nNikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi posting gains, and S&P 500 futures flat.\nAsian currencies have also clawed back early losses.\n\nWe continue to expect various sector-specific tariffs to follow, including\nlevies targeting semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, copper, lumber, and critical\nminerals, and there remains significant uncertainty over the scope and shape of\nthese Section 232 tariffs. Market volatility is likely to pick up, but the\nlatest development does not constitute an escalation in the trade war, in our\nview.\n\nThe renewed threat that \"reciprocal\" tariffs could again rise higher toward the\n2 April levels suggests that far fewer bilateral agreements are materializing\nthan the Trump administration had hoped for at this stage. So far, the White\nHouse has signed just three handshake deals, well short of prior suggestions\nthat 90 deals could be completed in 90 days. The fact that new sectoral tariffs\nmight be imposed on countries even after an agreement is reached is likely part\nof the reason negotiations remain challenging. Given Trump’s\nescalate-to-de-escalate negotiating approach, the US administration may be\nlooking to gain additional leverage in talks with these latest numbers. However,\nthe move did not come as a surprise, with Trump reiterating his intention\nmultiple times in the past several weeks. The new tariff rates are also similar\nto the levels announced in early April, suggesting that the administration’s\npurpose is not to re-escalate trade tensions.\n\nWith Trump leaving the door open for additional negotiations and a new deadline,\nwe continue to expect country-specific deals and arrangements in the coming\nweeks. These could include a baseline tariff and selective quotas or exemptions\nfrom sectoral tariffs in exchange for purchase commitments or US investment\npledges. It is worth noting that the impact of “reciprocal” tariffs can be less\nthan the announced headline rate after taking the carveouts into consideration.\nAdditionally, notable trading partners like the EU and India did not receive a\nletter this round, suggesting that some deals could be in the making. Reuters\nreported that the EU is close to an agreement with the US that may include\nconcessions on aircraft, medical equipment, and alcohol, while Trump indicated\nhe US could soon make a deal with India. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also\nsaid over the weekend that several deals are close.\n\nWhile the US administration may choose to pursue elevated tariffs for more\nleverage, a prolonged period of higher levies would likely increase economic\ncosts and could bring political consequences for both Trump and the Republican\nParty ahead of the midterm elections next year. With the One Big Beautiful Bill\nAct (OBBBA) estimated to add USD 4.1tr to the US deficit over the next decade,\nwe think trade policies or threats that risk a recession will ultimately be\nnegotiated lower. Tariff revenues are needed to help offset spending provisions\nin the OBBBA, but excessively high tariffs could reduce trade, growth, and tax\nrevenues.\n\nSo, while tariffs will likely remain high—compared with levels at the start of\nthe year—as will the headline risk, we think the US effective tariff rate should\nend the year at around 15%. This would be a headwind to growth but not enough to\ntrigger a recession given the resilience of the US consumer and the adaptability\nof global supply chains. We continue to recommend phasing into global equities\nor diversified portfolios to navigate volatility ahead."}

The draft Commerce\nDepartment rule would target shipments from companies like NVIDIA, following\nconcerns over semiconductor smuggling, as well as Chinese access to AI compute\ncapacity based in Southeast Asia. Malaysia has quietly emerged as a key AI data\ncenter hub, accounting for nearly 12% of NVIDIA's global sales last quarter.\nNVIDIA's exposure to Thailand is less clear.\n\nThe US administration reportedly plans to introduce these new controls with the\nrollback of the more stringent “AI diffusion” export curb system introduced\nunder the previous administration. If it goes through, this would mark the first\nmajor round of AI regulation under the new Trump administration since it\nscrapped the Biden-era rules. A similar proposal, the AI Diffusion Act, was\nintroduced in January 2025 but later rescinded.\n\nWithout taking any single-name views, we make several observations for global\ninvestors with AI exposure:\n\nWhile the proposal appears relatively modest, we believe additional restrictions\non AI chip exports could act still as a near-term overhang for cyclical tech\nstocks. Regulatory signals leading up to this have been relatively\naccommodative, with the White House reining in the Biden-era tiered AI diffusion\nrules. The recent rally in global tech was driven more by price-to-earnings\nmultiple expansion than by positive earnings revisions, which suggests less room\nfor any misses in second-quarter results. The upcoming earnings season also\nmeans the market is now in its peak blackout period for share buybacks, where\ncompanies are unable to step in and support share prices in the event of any\ndeclines.\n\nThe proposal reportedly includes a key concession: American data center\noperators will still be allowed to import US AI chips. This suggests major US\nhyperscalers, such as Google and Microsoft, can continue their regional data\ncenter expansions without significant disruption. We believe Malaysian companies\nprimarily serving US-backed projects should remain relatively insulated from the\nnew export restrictions. In contrast, data center operators building facilities\nspeculatively or targeting Chinese demand may be more exposed to order\ncancelations or project delays.\n\nOur analysis shows that AI compute, including GPUs and custom AI chips, has\nattracted the strongest capital investment so far in 2025. This is reflected in\nrobust spending commitments from the Big 4, sovereign buyers (including those in\nthe Middle East), neoclouds, but also likely some China-linked demand. That\nsaid, the early April ban on H20 AI chip exports to China has already done much\nof the heavy lifting. We expect AI compute’s share of total AI capex to rise\nfrom approximately 53% in 2024 to about 59% in 2025. As investment broadens into\nareas like high-bandwidth memory, networking, and industrial AI infrastructure,\nwe anticipate AI compute’s share will later normalize toward 50-55% from 2026\nonward.\n\nAgainst a backdrop of new potential chip restrictions and a broadening out of AI\ntrends, we recommend investors adopt a balanced portfolio stance within tech and\nthe AI value chain. Recently, we shifted our preferences away from some of the\ncyclical AI-linked stocks that rallied in June, tilting instead toward select AI\nlaggards as well as internet and software stocks. Amid heightened volatility, we\nthink investors may also want to consider structured strategies to help navigate\nmarket swings. Beyond near-term risks, we believe the robust secular trends in\nAI will continue to drive long-term gains in the tech sector. Data center stocks\nin Southeast Asia may be more sensitive in the near term to headline risk and\npotential policy changes. Within Chinese equities, we believe the impact on\nlarge-cap tech shares should be manageable."}

Every Democrat and two Republicans\nopposed the measure. The razor-thin margin followed weeks of tense negotiations,\nwith party leaders able to afford only a handful of defections. Despite internal\ndisagreements over the scale of spending cuts and deficit impact, the\nlegislation advanced enough of the party’s core agenda to secure passage, paving\nthe way for a 4 July presidential signing ceremony.\n\nThe OBBB ushers in a new era of fiscal policy, combining steep spending\nreductions with even larger, mostly permanent, cuts to individual and corporate\ntaxes. The bill also introduces temporary tax exemptions for tips, overtime, and\nseniors; increases funding for border security and defense,; and cuts spending\non programs such as Medicaid, nutrition, clean energy, and student loans.\n\nWhile the legislation lifts the debt ceiling by USD 5 trillion, averting a\nnear-term fiscal showdown, it is projected to add trillions to the US debt load\nover the next decade.\n\nFinancial markets had largely anticipated the move, with equities and US\nTreasury yields showing relatively limited reaction; the S&P 500 rose 0.8% on\nThursday, while the 10-year Treasury yield rose 7 basis points, but these moves\nwere in part in reaction to a stronger-than-expected jobs report.\n\n\nThe passage of the OBBB marks a significant shift in the US fiscal outlook. The\nCommittee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that the bill will add USD\n4.1 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, or USD 5.5 trillion if all tax\ncut provisions are made permanent. The legislation not only raises the debt\nceiling by USD 5 trillion, but also locks in a higher debt path for years to\ncome. While the immediate risk of a fiscal standoff later this summer has been\naverted, we see clear long-term implications: The US will face a much larger\ndebt burden, with increased Treasury issuance likely required to fund persistent\ndeficits.\n\nThe deficit, as a share of GDP, is now projected to remain around 7% through the\nnext ten years—substantially higher than the Congressional Budget Office’s\nJanuary forecast, which anticipated a decline to 5.2% by 2027. This sustained\nfiscal gap reflects both the scale of the tax cuts and the challenges of\nenacting meaningful spending reductions. As a result, we believe the US fiscal\nposition will remain under pressure, with debt sustainability concerns likely to\npersist.\n\nA notable feature of the OBBB is the decision by Senate Republicans to use the\ncurrent policy baseline, rather than current law, for scoring the bill’s impact\non the deficit. This approach allowed lawmakers to avoid technical deficit\nincreases from extending existing tax cuts, effectively sidestepping the Byrd\nRule’s restrictions on reconciliation. If this method becomes standard practice,\nit could further erode legislative fiscal restraint, making it easier for future\nunified governments to enact large tax cuts without fully accounting for their\nlong-term fiscal impact. This move may set a precedent that could shape US\nfiscal policy for years to come.\n\n\nWhile the final details of the OBBB were only settled this week, markets had\nalready priced in much of the expected fiscal and economic impact. However, the\nlonger-term outlook is clouded by persistent deficits and higher Treasury\nsupply, which could put upward pressure on yields, particularly at the long end\nof the curve, where debt sustainability concerns are most acute.\n\nThe OBBB’s passage provides a modest fiscal boost for 2026, and the bill’s tax\ncuts and spending reforms may support earnings growth at the margin. The bill’s\npassage, alongside progress this week on trade deals, is aligned with our view\nthat the second half of the year will bring improved clarity on US policy,\nhelping lay the groundwork for equity market gains in 2026. Investors who are\nunder-allocated to equities should consider gradually increasing exposure to\ndiversified global stocks or balanced portfolios to position for future gains.\n\nIn fixed income, US Treasury yields have declined over the past month even as\nthe larger-than-expected future Treasury supply became apparent. We expect the\ndeficit to be funded through increased short-end supply, especially Treasury\nbills. The 30-year yield has declined the least after rising more than other\npoints on the curve, reflecting the sensitivity of long-end yields to debt\nsustainability concerns. We favor high-quality investment grade bonds in the\nintermediate area of the yield curve as they offer attractive risk-return\nprofiles and historically attractive yields.\n\nSustained deficits near 7% of GDP and a rising debt load are likely to weigh on\nthe US dollar over time. We would reduce excess US dollar cash and diversify\ninto other major currencies such as the euro and Australian dollar.\nInternational investors should review their strategic currency allocations and\nconsider hedging US dollar exposure in US assets back into their home\ncurrencies, as fiscal concerns may drive further dollar weakness.\n\nThe OBBB’s potential precedent-setting approach to fiscal scoring and deficit\nexpansion increases the risk of future policy shifts and market volatility. We\ncontinue to see gold as a valuable long-term portfolio diversifier, supported by\nongoing fiscal and geopolitical risks, central bank demand, and the prospect of\ndeclining real interest rates. We maintain our USD 3,500/oz year-end target,\nversus USD 3,343 at the close of trading on Thursday. We recommend a\nmid-single-digit allocation to gold, alongside alternatives like hedge funds and\ncapital preservation strategies on equities."}
{"article_title": "Markets await more trade news after US-Vietnam deal", "publish_date": "2025-07-03", "url": "https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealthmanagement/insights/chief-investment-office/house-view/daily/2025/latest-03072025.onlycontent.html", "source": "UBS", "content": "(11:53)\n(4:41)\n(3:04)\n\nUS President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced the US had reached a trade\nagreement with Vietnam. The deal, which stemmed from direct talks with\nVietnamese General Secretary Tô Lâm, is said to impose a 20% tariff on\nVietnamese exports to the US, and a higher 40% levy on goods deemed to be\ntransshipped through the country. Trump said that Vietnam had agreed to drop all\nlevies on US imports in return.\n\nVietnam's state media on Thursday said President Trump has been invited for a\nstate visit to Vietnam, and that tariffs on several Vietnamese products would be\nsignificantly cut. No formal trade text has been publicly released, and it’s not\nclear how the transshipment provision (aimed largely at products rerouting from\nChina) would be implemented and enforced. In early April, Trump had imposed a\n46% duty on Vietnam as part of his initial rollout of the “reciprocal” tariffs,\nbefore pausing at a 10% level for negotiations.\n\nThe benchmark Vietnamese equity index fell 0.2% on Thursday, and regional\nmarkets in Asia were mixed. While we await more concrete details, we make\nseveral initial observations for global investors:\n\nThe draft Vietnam deal confirms that countries with sustained high trade\nsurpluses with the US, and those acting as transshipment hubs for Chinese goods,\nmay face higher baseline tariffs and additional duties on rerouted products. It\nalso confirms a broader US effort to ring-fence and curb perceived Chinese\noverproduction and excess capacity. In April, we warned of higher risks to\nVietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand over transshipments. It’s difficult to calculate\naccurately and estimates vary, but Nomura data suggest nearly 19% of Vietnam’s\nUS goods exports reflect Chinese value added, with Malaysia and Thailand next in\nline at 11.5% and 9.8%, respectively. We anticipate the economic pain will be\nfar more significant for Vietnam than China, given this represents a minimal\nfraction of China’s overall exports. Still, heavier penalties for transshippers\nshould further accelerate supply chain shifts out of China, as US companies\nstill need to source products competitively from compliant nations, in our view.\nWe would caveat that not all Asian economies fall in this transshipment bucket,\nwith North Asia, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Singapore less at risk.\n\nWhile Vietnam’s higher headline tariffs may appear to signal tougher outcomes\nelsewhere, we don’t see them as a template for other US trade talks. Vietnam is\namong the top 10 largest US trade partners, but less central than others now\nnegotiating. It’s also worth noting that our forecast for an overall US\neffective tariff rate of 15% assumes a 30-40% rate on Chinese exports in\nparticular. Despite the Vietnam deal’s indirect targeting of China, we note\npositive US-China steps this week on chip design software, ethane, and rare\nearths, and that there is plenty of time to reach a deal before the 90-day\nreciprocal tariff pause on China ends on 12 August. The US’s top two trade\npartners, Mexico and Canada, are on a separate track and are not subject to the\n10% baseline or “reciprocal” tariffs. Both have made progress on border issues,\nand we think they could ultimately agree to metal quotas and to limits on\nChinese transshipments. Overall, when factoring in sector-specific tariffs,\npotential carveouts, and some one-off less punitive bilateral deals, we think\nour year-end forecast for a 15% US effective tariff rate remains reasonable.\n\nWith the 9 July “reciprocal” tariff pause deadline looming, we expect the US\nadministration to announce several country-specific deals and further extensions\nfor countries negotiating \"in good faith,\" as well as bilateral escalations\naimed at strengthening US negotiating leverage. Following the Vietnam\nannouncement, Reuters reports Indian and US negotiators are pushing to land a\ndeal this week, with some officials reportedly told to be on standby for a\npotential announcement. Japan and South Korea have expressed more difficulty in\ntalks in public comments, but neither is walking away and could be granted\nextensions, in our view. We also note that purchase agreements have proven\npopular with the US administration.\n\nSo, on balance, we take the US-Vietnam accord as a positive step toward more\ndurable bilateral deals for the US and toward greater clarity for investors.\nWhile tariffs will likely slow US growth and add some inflation pressure into\n2026, we do not expect them to derail the economy or cause a recession. Headline\nrisks around trade may persist as negotiations continue, but we think the market\nimpact should moderate as President Trump’s negotiating tactics become\nincreasingly familiar. Ultimately, we expect the US administration to prioritize\neconomic stability over more maximalist tariffs, especially ahead of the 2026\nmidterm elections. After the current round of “reciprocal” tariff negotiations,\nwe think the next major milestone will likely be the announcement of\nsector-specific tariffs under Section 232 on pharma, semiconductors, and\ncritical minerals later this year. We continue to recommend gradually increasing\nexposure to diversified global stocks or balanced portfolios to position for\nstronger potential returns in 2026 and beyond."}
