This assessment is based on a balanced set of factors, with both bullish and bearish indicators influencing its trajectory. On the bullish side, the JPY is seen as a safe-haven currency, attracting inflows due to its stability and the size of the Japanese financial system. Recent capital inflows into Japan, contrasting with redemptions in other Asian markets, further support this positive sentiment. Additionally, the USD/JPY pair's tight trading range with an upside bias suggests potential for JPY strength. Conversely, bearish pressures stem from political uncertainties, particularly the ruling coalition's need for opposition support to pass legislation, which could lead to policy gridlock. The JPY has also underperformed due to market concerns about the ruling party's potential loss of majority in recent elections. Furthermore, the inability of the 10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yield to consistently surpass 1.60% indicates a lack of strong economic confidence, contributing to a bearish view.
